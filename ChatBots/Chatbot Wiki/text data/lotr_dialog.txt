Oh Smeagol Ive got one! , Ive got a fish Smeagol, Smeagol!     Pull it in! Go on, go on, go on, pull it in!  Arrghh!  Deagol!  Give us that! Deagol my love  Why?  Because' , it's my birthday and I wants it.  My precious.  They cursed us Murderer) 'Murderer' they called us. They cursed us and drove us away.     Gollum' Gollum' Gollum' , and we wept precious. We wept to be so alone.  and cool, so nice for feet' and we only wish to catch a fish    , so juicy sweet.  And we forgot the taste of bread, the sound of trees and the softness of     the wind. We even forgot our own name.      Gandalf?           Oooohhh!      Frodo!      Aaaahh!      Gimli!  My precious!     Wake up! , Wake up!     ,Wake up sleepies! We must go, yes, we must go at once.  Haven't you had any sleep Mr Frodo?  And I've gone and had too much. , It must be getting late.  No, it isn't. It isn't midday yet. , The days are growing darker.  Come on! Must go! No time!  Not before Mr Frodo's had something to eat.  No time to lose silly!  Here. What about you?  Oh no, I'm not hungry, leastways not for lembas bread.  Sam!      Aragorn!      Now come the days of the King. May they be blessed.     This day does not belong to one man, but to all. Let us together rebuild     this world, that we may share in the days of peace.      Et E'rello Endorenna ut'lien. Sinome maruvan ar Hildinyar tenn' Ambar-metta!         Hannon le.      My friends, , you bow to     no-one.      ,And thus     it was a Fourth Age of Middle Earth began. And the Fellowship of the Ring,     though eternally bound by friendship and love was ended.            Thirteen months to the day since Gandalf sent us on our long journey we find     ourselves looking upon a familiar sight.      We were home.      Alright!      Hey watch the pumpkin.     Goodnight lads.  Oh alright, but we don't have that much left. We have to be careful or     we are going to run out. You go ahead and eat that Mr Frodo. I've rationed     it, there should be enough.  For what?  The journey home.  Come Hobbitses, very close now. Very close to Mordor. No safe places here. Hurry.  It's good. Definitely from the Shire. ,Longbottom leaf eh?  uhh huh , I feel like I'm back at the Green Dragon.  Mmmm , Green Dragon!  A mug of ale in my hand. Putting my feet up on a settle after a hard     day's work.  Only, , you've never done a hard day's work.     Ahaha!  Welcome, my lords to Isengard!  You young rascals. A merry hunt you've led us on and now we find you     feasting and ' and smoking!      Hmm?      How do you pick up the threads of an old life? How do you go on, when in     your heart you begin to understand there is no going back? There are some     things that time cannot mend. Some hurts that go too deep, that have taken     hold.     Mr Frodo? What is it?      It's been four years to the day since Weathertop Sam. It's never really     healed.      , There and Back Again, a Hobbits tale     by Bilbo Baggins and the Lord of the Rings by Frodo Baggins. You finished     it.     Not quite. There's room for a little more.      Bilbo once told me his part in this tale would end. That each of us must     come and go in the telling. Bilbo's story was now over. There would be no     more journeys for him. , save one.      Tell me again lad, where are we going?     To the harbour Bilbo. The elves have accorded you a special honour. A place     on the last ship to leave Middle Earth.      Frodo, any chance of seeing that old Ring of mine again? The one I gave you?  We are sitting on a field of     victory enjoying a few well earned comforts , The salted pork is particularly good.  Salted pork'  Hobbits!  We're under orders from Treebeard who's taken over management of Isengard.         Hoooom, young master Gandalf, I'm glad you've come. Wood and water,     stock and stone I can master, but there is a Wizard to manage here locked in     his tower , Show yourself.     Be careful. Even in defeat, Saruman is dangerous.  Well then let's just have his head and be done with it.  No, we need him alive. We need him to talk.  You have fought many wars and slain many men Theoden King and made peace afterwards. Can we not take counsel together as we once did, my old friend?Can we not have peace you and I? We shall have peace'. We shall have peace when you answer for the     burning of the Westfold and the children that lie dead there! We shall have peace when the lives of the soldiers whose bodies were hewn even as they lay dead against the gates of the Hornburg' are avenged! When you hang from a gibbet for the sport of your own crows' we shall have peace!  Gibbets and crows! Dotard! What do you want Gandalf Grahame? Let me guess' the key of Orthanc? Or perhaps the keys of Barad D'r itself? Along with the crowns of the seven Kings and the rods of the Five Wizards!  Your treachery has already cost many lives. Thousands more are now at     risk. But you could save them Saruman. You were deep in the enemy's counsel.         I'm sorry uncle. I'm afraid I lost it.      Oh, pity. (He sighs.) I would have like to have held it one last time.      Oh! Well here is a sight I have never seen before.      The power of the three rings is ended. The time has come for the dominion of     men.      I Aear c'n ven na mar.      I think I'm quite ready for another adventure.      Farewell my brave Hobbits. , My work is now finished.    ,Here at last, on the     shores of the sea, comes the end of our Fellowship. , I will not say do not weep for not all     tears are an evil. , It is time Frodo.         What does he mean?      We set out to save the Shire Sam and it has been saved, but not for me.      , You don't mean that. You can't     leave.     The last pages are for you Sam.  So you have come here for information. I have some for you.    ,Something festers in the heart of Middle Earth. Something that you have failed to see. But the great eye has seen it! Even now he presses his advantage. His attack will come soon.     ,     You are all going to die! But you know this don't you Gandalf? You cannot think that this Ranger will ever sit upon the throne of Gondor. This exile, crept from the shadows will never be crowned King. ,Gandalf does not hesitate to sacrifice those who are closest to him' those he professes to love! Tell me, what words of comfort did you give the Halfling before you sent him to his doom? The path that you have set him on can only lead to death.  I've heard enough! Shoot him! Stick an arrow in his gob!  No! Come down Saruman and your life will be spared!  Save your pity and your mercy. I have no use for it!     Saruman'.. your staff is broken!  Grima! You need not follow him! You were not always as you are now. You were once a man of Rohan. Come down.  A man of Rohan? What is the house of Rohan but a thatched barn where brigands drink in the reek and their brats roll on the floor with the dogs? The victory at Helms Deep does not belong to you Theoden Horse Master. You are a lesser son of greater sires!  Grima'. Come down! Be free of him!  Free? He will never be free! No!      My dear Sam, you cannot always be torn in two. , You will     have to be one and whole for many years. You have so much to enjoy and to be     and to do. Your part in the story will go on.      Well, I'm back.     I didn't think it would end this way.    End?  No, the journey doesn't end here.  Death is just another path, one that we all must take.    ,  The grey rain curtain of this world rolls back and all turns to silvered glass.  And then you see it.       What?  Gandalf?  See what?       White shores and beyond,  a far green country under a swift sunrise.        Well, , that's not  so bad.       No.  No it isn't.       Rally to me!  To meeee!         Feast on his flesh.         I will kill you if you touch him.         The City has fallen silent.  There is no warmth left in the sun.        It grows so cold.       It's just the damp of the first spring rain.       I do not believe this darkness will endure.       Look!  The Orcs, they're moving off!     Get down cur!  Ah!  Saruman! You were deep in the enemy's counsel. Tell us what you know!  You withdraw your guard and I will tell you where your doom will be     decided. I will not be held prisoner here!  Send word to all our allies and to every corner of Middle Earth that     still stands free. The enemy moves against us. We need to know where he will     strike.  The filth of Saruman is washing away. Trees will come back to live here. ,Young trees. Wild trees.  Pippin!  Bless my bark!  Peregrin Took. I'll take that my lad! Quickly now!    Do not come between the Nazg'l and his prey.       Late as usual, pirate scum. ,  There's knifework here needs doing. Come on you sea rats, get off your ships.       There's plenty for the both of us, may be best Dwarf win!       You fool!  No man can kill me.  Die now!       I am no man!       You see Mr Frodo some luck at last!       Move it, you slugs!       Come on!  Faster!       Come along you scum! ,  I'll whip you down to the bone!  Come on!  What have I told you.    ,  Get up!    ,  Come on you slugs!  You two are going straight to the front line!  Move it, come on!  Fall in!  Move it! Move it! Move it!       To the gate you slugs, now move it! ,  Don't you know we're at war?       Company halt!  Inspection!       Sam!  Help me!       Mr Frodo!        Stand up Mr Frodo.  Stand up!       It's so heavy!       Oh no!  What do I do? ,  What do I do?      Hit me!  Hit me Sam!  Start fighting!       Get off of me! ,  Nobody pushes me you filthy maggot!    ,  Get off of me!          Retreat! The city is breached. Fall back to the second level. Get the     women and children out. Get them out. Retreat.      Come on, come on!      Move into the city. Kill all in your path.    Break it up!  Break it up!       Oy!  I'll have your guts if you don't shut this rabble down!         Go Sam.  Now!        Move along scum!        Get back in the line you maggots!  Get back in the line you slugs!       I can't!  I can't' I can't manage the Ring Sam.  It's' it's' such a weight to carry.  It's such a weight.             Take them down!      Fight! Fight to the last man. Fight for your lives.      Gandalf! ,     Gandalf! Denethor has lost his mind. He's burning Faramir alive!      Up! Quickly!      ,     Go back to the abyss! Fall into the nothingness that awaits you and your     master!      Do you not know death when you see it, old man? , This is my hour!         Gandalf!      AAAAhhh! ,      You have failed! The world of men will fall.      ,  We're going that way, straight as we can.  There's no point carrying anything we're not sure to need.       Mr Frodo, look. ,  There is light and beauty up there that no shadow can touch.        Take mine. ,  There's a few drops left.       There will be none left for the return journey.       I don't think there will be a return journey Mr Frodo.       Frodo, get down! ,  Hide!         Frodo!       Where are they?       Let the Lord of the Black Land come forth! ,  Let justice be done upon him!        My master Sauron the Great bids thee welcome.      Is there any in this rout with authority to treat with me?       We do not come to treat with Sauron, faithless and accursed.    Tell your master this.  The armies of Mordor must disband.  He is to depart these lands, never to return.         Courage Merry. Courage for our friends.      Form ranks you maggots. Form ranks. Pikes in front, archers behind.         Eomer, take your Eored down the left flank     Flank ready!     Gamling, follow the King's banner down the centre. Grimbold! Take your company right after you pass the wall. Forth and fear no darkness!     , Arise! Arise riders of Theoden. Spears shall be shaken, shields shall be splintered, a sword day, a red day ere the sun rises!!     Whatever happens, stay with me. I'll look after you.      Ride now, ride now! Ride! Ride for ruin and the world's ending! DEATH!     DEATH!    Aha!  Old Greybeard!  I have a token I was bidden to show thee.        Frodo!       Silence!       No!       The Halfling was dear to thee I see.  Know that he suffered greatly at the hands of his host.  Who would've thought one so small could endure so much pain?  And he did Gandalf, he did.         You may go no further.  You will not enter Gondor Who are you to deny us passage?  Legolas, fire a warning shot past the boson's ear.  Mind your aim. Oh! , That's     it, right, we warned you! Prepare to be boarded!  Boarded, by you and whose army?      Forth Eorlingas!      FIRE!      DEEEEAAATH!     CHAAAAARGE!      Fire at will!      Set a fire in our flesh!      Stay this madness!      You may triumph in the field of battle for a day, but against the power that     has risen in the east, there is no victory!      NOOOOOO, you will not take my son from me!      NO! Aaahhh     Faramir!      Aaaaaahhhh!      So passes Denethor, son of Ecthelion.   And who is this?  Isildur's heir?  It takes more to make a King than a broken Elvish blade.       I guess that concludes negotiations.         I do not believe it.  I will not.     This army.  In there.   What is this place?  Master must go inside the tunnel.  Now that I'm here I don't think I want to.  It's the only way. Go in' or go back.  I can't go back.  What's that smell. Orcses' filth. Orcses come in here sometimes.  Hurry! This way. Smeagol?  Over here.  Ah aah! Its sticky, what is it?   You'll see. Oh yes, you     will see.   Drive them to the river.,       Make safe the city.,       Re-form the line!  Re-form the line!,       Sound the charge.  Take them head-on. Chaaarge!,       Cut him down!,       Take the reins, pull him left. ,  LEFT!,       Aim for the heads! ,       Bring it down! Bring it down!  Bring it down!,       Merry!,     Smeagol? (shouts) SMEAGOL! SMEAGOL!  Sam.  Ow!  And you Frodo Baggins, I give you the light of E'rendil, our most beloved star. , May it be a light for you in dark places, when all other lights go out.  Aiya E'rendil Elenion Ancalim'  Naughty little fly. Why does he cry? ,Caught in a web. Soon     you'll be eaten.  Got away did it precious? Not this time. Not this time.     NO!  It wasn't us. It wasn't us. ,Smeagol wouldn't hurt master. We promised. You must believe us. It was the precious. The precious made us do it.  I have to destroy it Smeagol. , I have to destroy it for both our sakes.  NO! , Aaaaaaaaa. I'm so sorry Sam.     I'm so sorry.  What kind of army would linger in such a place?  One that is cursed. Long ago the men of the mountains swore an oath to     the last King of Gondor , to come to his aid, to fight. But when     the time came, when Gondor's need was dire, they fled vanishing into the     darkness of the mountain. And so Isildur cursed them, never to rest until     they had fulfilled their pledge. Who shall call them from the grey twilight,     the forgotten people? The heir of him to whom the oath they swore. From the     North shall he come, need shall drive him. He shall pass the door to the     Paths of the Dead.  The very warmth of my blood seems stolen away.  The way is shut. It was made by those who are dead , and the dead keep it. The     way is shut.  Brego!  I do not fear death!  This task was appointed to you, Frodo of the Shire. If you do not find a     way, no one will.  The scouts report Minas Tirith is surrounded. The lower level's in flames. Everywhere, legions of the enemy advance.  Time is against us. Make ready! Take heart Merry. , It will soon be over My lady. You are fair and brave and have much to live for    , and many who love you. I     know it is too late to turn aside. I know there is not much point now in     hoping. If I were a knight of Rohan capable of great deeds'but I'm not. I'm a Hobbit. And I know I can't save Middle Earth. I just want to help my friends; Frodo, Sam, Pippin. More than anything I wish I could see them again.  Prepare to move out!  Make haste. We ride through the night.  To battle Back to the gate! Hurry! Well this is a thing unheard of. An elf will go underground, where a     dwarf dare not. Oh. Oh, I'd never hear the end of it.  We must ride light and swift. It is a long road ahead and man and beast     must reach the end with the strength to fight.  Little Hobbits do not belong in war Master Meriadoc.  All my friends have gone to battle. I would be ashamed to be left     behind.  It is a three-day gallop to Minas Tirith and none of my riders can bear     you as a burdon.   I want to fight! I will say no more.  Ride with me!  My lady!  Form up, move out! Form up, move out!  Ride! Ride now to Gondor. What is it? What do you see?  I see shapes of men and of horses. Where?  Pale banners like shreds of cloud. , Spears rise     like winter thickets through a shroud of mist. The dead are following. They     have been summoned.   The dead?     Summoned? I knew that! Huh. Huh. , Very good. Very good. , Legolas!  Do not look down.  Who enters my domain? One who will have your allegiance.  The dead do not suffer the living to pass.  You will suffer me!  The way is shut! It was made by those who are dead. And the dead keep     it. (The Ghostly army closes around them) The way is shut! Now you must die!      I summon you to     fulfil your oath!  None but the King of Gondor may command me!  Make way for the King! Make way, the King is here My lord!  Hail to you sire!  I bring 500 men from the Westfold my lord.  We have 300 more from Fenmarch, Theoden King.  That blade was broken! It has been remade. ,     Fight for us and regain your honour. What say you? ,What say you? Ach! You waste your time Aragorn. They had no honour in life and they     have none now in death.  I am Isildur's heir. Fight for me and I will hold your oaths fulfilled.    ,What say you?     You have my word! Fight and I will release you from this living death!    , What say you?  Stand you traitors!  Out!  Legolas! Run!  We fight!  Open the gate, quick!  Quick! Hurry!  Faramir! Say not that he has fallen.  They were outnumbered! None survived.  Fear. The city is rank with it! Ha ha ha ha. Let us ease their pain.     Release the prisoners!  Where are the riders from Snowbourn?  None have come my lord.  Six thousand spears, less than half of what I had hoped for. Six thousand will not be enough to break the lines of Mordor.   More will come     Every hour lost hastens Gondor's defeat. , We have until dawn then we must ride.  The horses are restless and the men are quiet. They grow nervous in the shadow of the mountain.  That road there where does that lead?  It is the road to the Dimholt, the door under the mountain.  Catapults! , ha ha ha.     My sons are spent! ,     My line has ended!  He's alive!   The     house of Stewards has failed.  He needs medicine my lord!  My line has ended!  My lord! Rohan has deserted us!  Theoden's betrayed me! ABANDON YOUR POSTS! ,FLEE! FLEE FOR YOUR LIVES!  Prepare for battle. Hurry men! To the wall! Defend the wall! Over here!     Return to your posts. Send these foul beasts into the Abyss.  Stay where you are!  We need more rubble! None who venture there ever return. That mountain is evil.  Aragorn! ,     Let's find some food.  There. A true esquire of Rohan.  I'm ready! , Sorry. It isn't all that dangerous. It's not     even sharp.  To the smithy, go!       You should not encourage him. You should not doubt him.  I do not doubt his heart, only the reach of his arm.     Why should Merry be left behind? He has as much cause to go to war as     you. Why can he not fight for those he loves?  You know as little of war as that Hobbit. When the fear takes him    , and the blood and the     screams and the horror of battle take hold. Do you think he would stand and     fight? He would flee. And he would be right to do so.    , War is the     province of men Eowyn.  Sir? King Theoden awaits you my lord.  Watch out!  Down to the lower levels quick!  Double up men!  Hold them back, do not give in to fear. Stand to your posts. Fight!  Not at the towers! Aim for the trolls, kill the trolls! Bring them down!  Fight them back! ,Peregrin Took! Go back to the Citadel. They called us out to fight.  This is no place for a Hobbit!  Guard of the Citadel indeed! , Now back up the hill     quickly. Quick!  What are you doing you useless scum?  The door wont give. It's too strong.  I take my leave.   My lord Elrond I come on behalf of one whom I love. Arwen is dying. She will not long     survive the evil that now spreads from Mordor. The light of the evenstar is     failing. As Sauron's power grows her strength wanes. Arwen's life is now     tied to the fate of the Ring. The Shadow is upon us Aragorn. The end has     come. It will not be our end, but his.   You ride to war     but not to victory. Sauron's armies ride on Minas Tirith, this you know.     But in secret he sends another force, which will attack, from the river.    , A fleet of Corsair ships sails from the South. They will be     in the city in two days. You're outnumbered Aragorn. You need more men. There are none. There are those that dwell in the mountain.  Murderers, traitors. You would call upon them to fight? They believe in     nothing. They answer to no one They will answer to the King of Gondor. , And'ril, the Flame of the West, forged from the shards of     Narsil.  Sauron will not have forgotten the sword of Elendil.  The blade that was broken shall return to Minas Tirith.  The man who can wield the power of this sword can summon to him an army     more deadly than any that walks this earth. Put aside the Ranger. Become     who you were born to be 'nen i-Estel Edain.  '-chebin Estel anim.  Why are you doing this? The war lies to the East. You cannot leave on     the eve of battle. You cannot abandon the men.  What were you thinking Peregrin Took? What service can a Hobbit offer     such a great lord of men?  , It was     well done. A generous deed should not be checked with cold counsel.    ,     You are to join the tower guard. I didn't think they would find any livery that would fit me.  It once belonged to a young boy of the city. A very foolish one who     wasted many hours slaying dragons instead of attending his studies.  This was yours?  Yes, it was mine. My father had it made for me.  Get back there and smash it down! But nothing can breach it!  Grond will breach it! , Bring out the wolf's head. Grond, Grond, Grond, Grond,     Grond! Grond, Grond, Grond, Grond!  Eowyn' We need you here.  Why have you come? Do you not know? It is but a shadow and a thought that you love. I cannot give you what     you seek. I have wished you joy since first I saw you.   Just where do you     think you're off to? Not this time. This time you must stay Gimli. Hmmmm  Have you learnt nothing of the stubbornness of     dwarves?  You might as well accept it. We're going with you laddie. Aragorn     smiles. What's happening, where is he going? I don't understand. (, Lord Aragorn! Why does     he leave on the eve of battle?  He leaves because there is no hope. He leaves because he must.  Well, I'm taller than you were then. Though, I'm not likely to grow     anymore, except sideways.  It never fitted me either. Boromir was always the soldier.    , They were so alike he and     my father. Proud, stubborn even, but strong.  I think you have strength of a different kind. And one day your father     will see it.  Here do I swear fealty and service to Gondor in peace or war, in living     or dying, from , ' from this hour henceforth     until my lord release me or death take me. And I shall not forget it!, nor fail to reward that which is given.    ,     Fealty with love. ,     Valour with honour. Disloyalty with vengeance.     ,     I do not think we should so lightly abandon the outer defences. Defences     that your brother long held intact.  What would you have me do? I will not yield the River and Pellenor unfought. Osgiliath must be     retaken.  My lord Osgiliath is over run.  Much must be risked in war. Is there a Captain here who still has the     courage to do his lord's will?  You wish now that our places had been exchanged. That I had died and     Boromir had lived.  Yes, I wish that.  To few have come. We cannot defeat the armies of Mordor.  No, we cannot. But we will meet them in battle nonetheless.     I have left instruction. , The people are to follow your rule in     my stead.     Take up my seat in the Golden Hall. Long may you defend Edoras, if the     battle goes ill.  What other duty would you have me do my lord? Duty? ,     no. , I     would have you smile again, not grieve for those whose time has come. You     shall live to see these days renewed , ' and no more despair Since you are robbed of Boromir I will do what I can in his stead.    ,     If I should return, think better of me father.  That will depend on the manner of your return.  Ech!  What are you up to? Sneaking off are we?  Sneaking? Sneaking? Fat Hobbit is always so polite. Smeagol shows     them secret ways that nobody else could find and they say 'sneak!' Sneak?     Very nice friend, oh yes my precious very nice , very nice! Alright! Alright! You just startled me is all. What were you doing?     Sneaking. Fine, have it your own way. , I'm sorry to wake you Mr Frodo but we have to be     moving on. It's dark still.  It's always dark here. , It's gone!    , The elven bread!     What? That's all we have left!  We can't hold them. The city is lost. Tell the men to break cover. We ride for Minas Tirith. Nazg'l!  Take cover! Nazgul! Fall     back. Fall back to Minas Tirith!  He took it. He must have.  Smeagol? No, no, not poor Smeagol. Smeagol hates nasty elf bread.     You're a lying rat! What did you do with it?   He doesn't     eat it. , He can't have taken     it.  Look, what's this? , Crumbs on his jacketses. He took it!,He took it! , I've seen him, he's always stuffing his face when master's     not looking. That's a filthy lie! ,     You stinking, two faced sneak!  Sam!  Call me' Stop it!  I'll kill him! Sam, no!  Oh my! I'm sorry. I didn't mean it to go so far. I was just     so, so angry! Here just' let's just rest a bit. I'm all right.  No. No you're not all right, you're exhausted. It's that Gollum. It's     this place. It's that thing around your neck. , I could help a bit. I could carry it for     a while ,,     carry it for a while ,     I could carry it' I could carry it' Share the load' share the load' share     the load  Get away! Fall back! , Retreat! Retreat! Run for your lives!  The age of men is over. The time of the Orc has come. Keep going. It's the Nazgul. Take cover my lord.    ,     It's coming.  Its Mithrandir! The White Rider!  Pull! Mithrandir! ,     They broke through our defences. They've taken the bridge and the West     bank. Battalions of Orcs are crossing the river.  It is as the Lord Denethor predicted! Long has he foreseen this doom!     Foreseen and done nothing!  Faramir? This is not the first Halfling to have crossed your path. No.  You've seen Frodo and Sam?  Where? When? I don't want to keep it. , I just want to help.  See? See? He wants it for himself.  Shut up you! , Go away! Get     out of here! No Sam! It's you! ,     I'm sorry Sam.   But he's a liar! He's poisoned     you against me.  You can't help me any more.  You don't mean that.  Go home.   Faramir! Faramir!    , Your     father's will has turned to madness. Do not throw away your life so     rashly.  Where does my allegiance lie if not here? This is the city of the men     of N'menor. I will gladly give my life to defend her beauty, her memory,     her wisdom. Your father loves you Faramir. , He will remember it before the end.  Can you sing Master Hobbit?  well, yes. At least well     enough for my own people. But we have no songs for great halls and evil     times. Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift.           The battle for Helm's Deep is over. The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin.           (looking back out to Mordor) All our hopes now lie with two little Hobbits...           In Ithilien. Not two days ago. Gandalf, they're taking the road to the     Morgul vale.  And then the pass of Cirith Ungol. What does that mean? What's wrong? He looks at Gandalf. Faramir tell me everything. Tell me all you know.  This is how you would serve your city? You would risk its utter     ruin?  I did what I judged to be right. What you judged to be right! You sent the Ring of power into Mordor in     the hands of a witless Halfling! It should have been brought back to the     citadel to be kept safe. Hidden. Dark and deep in the vaults' not to be     used. ,     unless, at the uttermost end of need. I would not use the Ring. Not if Minas Tirith were falling in ruin and     I alone could save her.  Ever you desire to appear lordly and gracious as a King of old.     Boromir would have remembered his father's need. He would have brought me     a kingly gift Boromir would not have brought the Ring. He would have stretched     out his hand to this thing and taking it he would have fallen.  And why should your songs be unfit for my halls? Come, sing me a song.     Home is behind, The world ahead, , And     there are many paths to tread, Through shadow, to the edge of night    ,     Until the stars are all alight., Mist and shadow     cloud and shade, All shall fade, All shall , 'fade.     March, march! March, march march!  ...somewhere in the wilderness.           I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.     What?           I wonder if people will ever say,      "Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring."      And they'll say,      "Yes! That's one of my favourite stories."      "Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, Dad? "      "Yes, my boy. ,The most famousest of Hobbits.      And that's saying a lot.",     Well, you've left out one of the chief characters:      "Samwise the Brave."      I want to hear more about Sam.           Frodo wouldn't have got far      without Sam.           Now, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn't make fun. I was being serious.           So was l. ,     "Samwise the Brave."      Smeagol?           We're not going to wait for you. Come on.,     Master. Master looks after us. ,Master wouldn't hurt us.           Master broke his promise.           Don't ask Smeagol. Poor, poor Smeagol.           Master betrayed us. Wicked. Tricksy. False. ,We ought to wring his filthy little neck.,Kill him! Kill him! Kill them both! ,And then we take the precious......and we be the master!           You know nothing of this matter! He would have kept it for his own. And when he returned you would not     have known your son.       Boromir was loyal to me! Not some wizard's pupil. Father?  My son! , Leave me!  Careful master! Careful. Very far to fall. Very dangerous are the     stairs.  Come master.  Come to Smeagol. Mr Frodo! , Get back     you! Don't touch him.  Why does he hates poor Smeagol? What has Smeagol ever done to him?     Master? ,Master carries a heavy     burden Smeagol knows, heavy heavy burden. Fat one cannot know. , He wants it. He needs     it. Smeagol sees it in his eye. , Very soon he will ask you for it. You     will see. The fat one will take it from you!      Send forth all legions. Do not stop the attack until the city is     taken.  But the fat Hobbit, he knows.      Eyes always watching.                 Then we stabs them out. Put out his eyeses and make him crawl.           Yes. Yes. Yes.           Kill them both.           Yes. , No! No! ,It's too risky. It's too risky.           Where is he? Where has he gone? Hey, Gollum! Where are you?           We could let , do it.           Yes. She could do it.           Yes, precious, she could. And then we takes it once they're dead.           Once they're dead. ,Ssssssssssssssh!           Come on, Hobbits. Long ways to go yet. , Smeagol will show you the way.           Stay out of the forest! Keep away from the trees!           Final count.....42.           Forty-two? That's not bad for a pointy-eared Elvish princeling. I myself am sitting pretty on 43.,      Forty-three.           He was already dead.           Slay them all! What of the wizard? I will break him. Where are Theoden's riders? Will Rohan's army come? Mithrandir? Courage is the best defence that you have now.  Follow me.           He was twitching.           He was twitching......because he's got my axe ,embedded in his nervous system!           He doesn't look too happy, does he?           Not too happy at all, Merry.           Still, I suppose the view would be quite nice from up there.           Oh, yes. It's a quality establishment. I hear the staff are very good.           What are you doing?           Nothing. The world's back to normal, that's all.           No, it isn't. I'm starving.           Good luck trying to find something decent around here. ,Probably only dead rats and      mouldy bread.,     Saruman's storeroom!           I don't believe it.           It can't be.           lt is!           Longbottom Leaf. ,The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing.           It's perfect. One barrel each.,Wait.      Do you think we should share it with Treebeard?           Share it? ,No. No. ,Dead plant and all that. Don't think he'd understand. ,Could be a distant relative.           I get it. Don't be hasty.            Exactly.      , Bar-hrum.      This is the old sewer. Runs right under the river through to the edge of the city.      You'll find cover in the woods there.     Captain Faramir......you have shown your quality, sir.           The very highest.           The Shire must truly be a great realm      Master Gamgee......where gardeners are held in high honor.           What road will you take once you reach the woods?           Gollum says there's a path......near Minas Morgul that climbs up into the mountains.,     Cirith Ungol?,     ls that its name?           No. ,No! , Yes.           Frodo......they say a dark terror dwells in the passes above Minas      Morgul. You cannot go that way.           lt is the only way. Master says we must go to Mordor, so we must try.           I must.            Go, Frodo. Go with the goodwill of all Men.,     Thank you.           May death find you quickly if you bring them to harm.           Come on, keep up.           Mr. Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers to hurt you. You know that, don't you?      He was trying to save you, see?           Save me?           So there's no hard feelings. Forgive and forget.           No, no, no hard feelings. Gollum, Gollum. ,Yes, master. Nice Hobbits.           Very decent of you. Very decent, indeed      Gollum.     Faramir! Orcs have taken the eastern shore. Their numbers are too great.      By nightfall we will be overrun.           Mr. Frodo?           It's calling to him, Sam. His Eye is almost on me.            Hold on, Mr. Frodo. You'll be all right.           Take them to my father. ,Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.      ,A weapon that will change our fortunes      in this war. ,     Do you want to know      what happened to Boromir? ,You want to know why your brother died? He tried to take the Ring from Frodo after swearing an oath to protect him! ,He tried to kill him! The Ring drove your brother mad!           Watch out!           They're here.           They've come.           Nazgul!           Stay here. Keep out of sight. ,Take cover!           The fortress is taken. It is over.,     You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it.      They still defend it. They have died defending it.           They are breaking in!           They're past the door!           Is there no other way for the women      and children to get out of the caves?      Is there no other way?           There is one passage. It leads into the mountains. But they will not get far.      The Uruk-hai are too many.            Tell the women and children      to make for the mountain pass. And barricade the entrance!           Aragorn! Fall back to the Keep! Get your men out of there!,     Nan Barad! Nan Barad! , Haldir, nan Barad! ( What are you doing? What are you stopping for?       Nan Barad! (To the Keep!)       Haldir!       So much death. , What can Men do against such reckless hate?           Ride out with me. ,Ride out and meet them.,     For death and glory.           For Rohan. For your people.           The sun is rising.           Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day. At dawn......Iook to the east.           Yes.........Yes.........The horn of Helm Hammerhand......shall sound in the Deep......one last time.

As long as you can give me.       Gimli!       Timbers! Brace the gate!       Come on. We can take them.       It's a long way.       Toss me.       Not alone. , Rohirrim!           Eomer.,     To the king!           Yes!           A hit. A fine hit.           Break the dam! Release the river!           Pippin! Hold on!           Hold on, little Hobbits.           What are you doing?           Where are you going?           It's me. It's your Sam. Don't you know your Sam?           What?       I cannot jump the distance! You'll have to toss me!        Don't tell the Elf.       Not a word.  Shore up the door!       Make way!       Follow me to the barricade.       Watch our backs!       Throw another one over here!     Higher!

It's all wrong.      ,By rights, we shouldn't even be here.      But we are. It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered.      ,Full of darkness and danger they were.      And sometimes you didn't want to know the end.....because how could the end be happy?      How could the world go back      to the way it was...... when so much bad had happened?           Victory! We have victory!           But in the end, it's only a passing thing...... this shadow. Even darkness must pass.      A new day will come. And when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer.      Those were the stories      that stayed with you......that meant something. Even if you were too small      to understand why. But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now.           Folk in those stories......had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't.      They kept going......because they were holding on to something.     What are we holding on to, Sam?           That there's some good in this world, Mr. Frodo. And it's worth fighting for.           I think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins. ,     You know the laws of our country, the laws of your father. If you let them go      your life will be forfeit.           Then it is forfeit. Release them.,     They have broken through! The castle is breached. Retreat!       Fall back!       Retreat!       Hurry! Inside. Get them inside!       Into the Keep!       I will leave you at the western borders of the forest. You can make your way north      to your homeland from there.       Wait! Stop! Stop! Turn around. Turn around. Take us south.       South? But that will lead you past lsengard.       Yes. Exactly.,If we go south, we can slip      past Saruman unnoticed. The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm.      It's the last thing he'll expect.       That doesn't make sense to me.      But then......you are very small. ,Perhaps you're right. South it is, then.      Hold on, little Shirelings. ,I always like going south. Somehow it feels like going downhill.,      Are you mad? We'll be caught.       No, we won't. Not this time.       Look! Osgiliath burns!       Mordor has come.       The Ring will not save Gondor.      , It has only the power to destroy.      Please......Iet me go.       Hurry.       Faramir! You must let me go!       And those little family of field mice......that climb up sometimes, and they tickle me awfully.       They're always trying to get somewhere where they....       Many of these trees were my friends. Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.       I'm sorry, Treebeard.       They had voices of their own.       Saruman. A wizard should know better!       There is no curse in Elvish......Entish or the tongues of Men......for this treachery.       You could have picked a better spot.,     Well, lad, whatever luck you live by, let's hope it lasts the night.       Your friends are with you, Aragorn.       Let's hope they last the night.        A      Eruch'n, '-dano i faelas a hyn an uben tanatha le faelas! ,     What's happening out there?       Shall I describe it to you? Or would you like me to find you a box?        Look! The trees! They're moving!       Where are they going?       They have business with the Orcs. My business is with lsengard tonight......with rock and stone.       Yes!       Come, my friends. The Ents are going to war. It is likely......that we go to our doom.      Last march......of the Ents.       So it begins.       Tangado a chadad!   Faeg i-varv d'n na lanc a      nu ranc.

I have told your names to the Entmoot......and we have agreed......you are not      Orcs.,     Well, that's good news.  And what about Saruman? Have you come to a decision about him?       Now, don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.       Hasty? Our friends are out there. ,They need our help. They cannot fight this war on their own.       War? Yes. It affects us all. Tree, root and twig.      But you must understand, young Hobbit......it takes a long time......to say anything in Old      Entish... ,...and we never say anything......unless it is worth taking......a long time to say.,     Seventeen! Eighteen! Nineteen! Twenty! Twenty-one!       Causeway!       Is this it? Is this is all you can conjure      Saruman?       Togo hon dad, Legolas! , Dago hon! Dago hon!  Hold them! Stand firm!       Hado i philinn!  Herio!  The Ents cannot hold back this storm. We must weather such things as we have always done.,     How can that be your decision?!       This is not our war.,      But you're part of this world!      Aren't you?!,     You must help. Please. You must do something.       You are young and brave, Master Merry. But your part in this tale is over.      Go back to your home.,     Maybe Treebeard's right. We don't belong here, Merry. It's too big for us.      What can we do in the end? We've got the Shire. Maybe we should go home.,     The fires of lsengard will spread......and the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.      And.... ,And all that was once green and good      in this world will be gone. There won't be a Shire, Pippin.       Boromir! Boromir! This city was once the jewel of our kingdom. A place of light and beauty     and music. And so it shall be once more! ,Let the armies of Mordor know this:     Never again will the land of my people fall into enemy hands.    ,This city of Osgiliath has been     reclaimed ,for     Gondor! For Gondor!  For Gondor! Good speech. Nice and short. Leaves more time for drinking!     Break out the ale! These men are thirsty!     Remember today, little brother. Today, life is good. What? He's here.  One moment of peace, can he not give us that? Where is he? Where is Gondor's finest? Where's my first-born?     Father! They say you vanquished the enemy almost single-handedly. They exaggerate. The victory belongs to Faramir also.  But for Faramir, this city would still be standing. Were you not entrusted to protect it? I would have done, but our numbers were too few. Oh, too few. You let the enemy walk in and take it on a whim. Always you     cast a poor reflection on me.  That is not my intent. You give him no credit, and yet he tries to do your will. He loves you, Father. Do not trouble me with Faramir......I know his uses, and they are few.     We have more urgent things to speak of. Elrond of Rivendell has called a     meeting. He will not say why, but I have guessed its purpose. It is rumored     that the weapon of the enemy has been found.  The One Ring. lsildur's     Bane. lt has fallen into the hands of     the Elves. Everyone will try to claim it: Men, Dwarves, wizards. We cannot     let that happen. This thing must come to Gondor.  Gondor.  It's dangerous,     I know. Ever the Ring will seek to corrupt the hearts of lesser Men. But     you, you are strong.    And our need is great. It is our blood which is being spilled, our people     who are dying. Sauron is biding his time. He's massing fresh armies. He will     return. And when he does, we will be powerless to stop him. You must go.    ,Bring me back this     mighty gift    . No. My place is here with     my people. ,Not in Rivendell. Would you deny your own father? lf there is need to go to Rivendell......send me in his stead. You? Oh, I see. A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor, to show his     quality. I think not. ,I trust this mission only to your brother. The one who will not     fail me. Remember today, little brother.  Captain Faramir! ,We     found the third one. You must come with me. Now.   Down there. To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death.    ,They wait for my command. Shall I     shoot? The rock and pool    Is nice and cool    So juicy sweet    Our only wish    To catch a fish    So juicy sweet  Wait. This creature is bound to me. And I to him. He is our guide.     Please......Iet me go down to him. Smeagol. , Master is here.     Come, Smeagol. Trust master. Come.  We must go now? Smeagol, you must trust master. Follow me. Come on. Come. Come, Smeagol.     Nice Smeagol. That's it. Come on. Don't hurt him! ,Smeagol, don't struggle. Smeagol, listen     to me. May the grace of the Valarprotect you.  Brego. Arwen. ,Tollen i l'.

I told you he was false. Master is our friend. Our friend. Master betrayed us.  No. Not its business. Leave us alone! Filthy little     Hobbitses! They stole it from us! There is still hope. If Aragorn survives this waryou will still be parted.If Sauron is defeatedand Aragorn made king......and all that you hope forcomes true......you will still have to tastethe bitterness of mortality. Whether by the swordor the slow decay of time......Aragorn will die.And there will be no comfortfor you......no comfort to ease the painof his passing.He will come to death......an image of the splendorof the kings of Men......in glory undimmed beforethe breaking of the world. But you, my daughter......you will linger on in darknessand in doubt......as nightfall in winterthat comes without a star.Here you will dwell......bound to your griefunder the fading trees...... until all the world is changed......and the long years of your lifeare utterly spent.

I amar prestar aen... han mathon ne nen, han mathon ne chae a han noston     ned 'wilith.                      What news? Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan. , Theoden's people have fled     to Helm's Deep. But we must look to our own borders. Faramir, Orcs are on     the move. Sauron is marshaling an army. Easterlings and Southrons are at the     Black Gate. How many? Some thousands. More come every day. Who's covering the river to the north? We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath. If their city is attacked, we won't hold     it. No. No. What did they steal?      My precious!  We have to get out of here.     You go. Go, now. You can do it. Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo. Just this once. Put     it on. Disappear.  I can't. You were right, Sam. You tried to tell me but....,I'm sorry. The Ring's taking me, Sam. If I put it     on......he'll find me. He'll see. Mr.     Frodo.... So this is the answer to all the riddles. ,Here in the     Wild I have you......two Halflings......and a host of men at my call.,The Ring of Power within my     grasp.,A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor......to     show his quality.  No!  Stop it! Leave him alone. ,Don't you understand? He's got to destroy     it! That's where we're going, into Mordor. To the Mountain of Fire!  Osgiliath is under attack. They call for reinforcements.  Please. It's such a burden.     Will you not help him? Captain?  Prepare to leave.    ,The Ring will go to Gondor.      Mae carnen, Brego,     mellon n'n.      Saruman attacks from lsengard. Sauron from Mordor. The fight will come to     Men on both fronts. Gondor is weak. Sauron will strike us soon. And he will     strike hard. He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him. My men tell me that you are Orc spies. Spies? Now wait just a minute. Well, if you're not spies, then who are you? Speak. We are Hobbits of the Shire. Frodo Baggins is my name, and this is     Samwise Gamgee. Your bodyguard? His gardener. And where is your skulking friend? That gangrel creature. He had an ill-favored     look. There was no other.    ,We set out from Rivendell with seven companions. One we lost in Moria......two     were my kin......a Dwarf there was also. And an Elf and two Men. Aragorn,     son of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.  You're a friend of Boromir? Yes. For my part. He's alive! Where is he? Where is he?,Get out of the     way! I'm going to kill him!,You are the luckiest, the canniest    ,.....and the most reckless man     I ever knew. Bless you, laddie.  Gimli, where is the king?  Le abdollen. ,You look terrible.     Hannon le.  A great host, you say? All lsengard is emptied. Ten thousand strong at least.      Ten thousand? It is an army bred for a single purpose: To destroy the world of Men.     They will be here by nightfall. Let them come! I want every man and strong     lad able to bear arms......to be ready for battle by nightfall.     We will cover the causeway and the gate from above. No army has ever     breached the Deeping Wall......or set foot inside the Hornburg! It will grieve you then to     learn that he is dead. Dead? How? When? As one of his companions, I'd hoped you would tell me. If something has happened to Boromir, we would have you tell us. His horn washed up upon the riverbank, about six days past. It was     cloven in two. But more than this, I know it in my heart.    ,He was my brother. This is no rabble of mindless Orcs. These are Uruk-hai. Their armour is     thick and their shields broad. I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf. I know how to defend my own keep. They will break upon this fortress like water on rock.    ,Saruman's     hordes will pillage and burn.    We've seen it before. Crops can be resown......homes rebuilt. Within these     walls......we will outlast them. They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages. They come to     destroy its people......down to the last child. What would you have me do? Look at my men. Their courage hangs by a     thread. If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an     end......as to be worthy of remembrance. Send out riders, my lord. You must call for aid.  And who will come? Elves? Dwarves? We are not so lucky in our friends as     you. The old alliances are dead. Gondor will answer. (    Gondor?! Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?! Where was Gondor when our     enemies closed in around us?! Where was Gon--? ,No, my Lord     Aragorn......we are alone. ,Get the women and children     into the caves.

Oh, yes, we could.Spoil a nice fish. ,Give it to us raw...    ,...and wriggling.You keep nasty chips. You're hopeless. Mr. Frodo? Who are they? You have some skill with a blade. Women of this country learned long ago:Those without swordscan still die upon them.I fear neither death nor pain. What do you fear, my lady? A cage.To stay behind bars until useand old age accept them.And all chance of valor has gonebeyond recall or desire. You're a daughter of kings......a shieldmaiden of Rohan.I do not think that would be your fate.  Theoden will not stay at Edoras.It's vulnerable. He knows this.,He will expect an attack on the city.,They will flee to Helm's Deep......the great fortress of Rohan.,It is a dangerous road to takethrough the mountains.,They will be slow.,They will have women and childrenwith them.  Send out your Warg-riders. Hey, stinker, don't go gettingtoo far ahead. Why do you do that? Call him names.Run him down all the time. Because.Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.There's naught left in himbut lies and deceit.It's the Ring he wants.It's all he cares about. You have no idea what it did to him......what it's still doing to him.,I want to help him, Sam. Why? What is it? What do you see? Warg! We're under attack! Get them out of here! All riders to the head of the column. Come on. Get me up here. I'm a rider.Come on! You must lead the peopleto Helm's Deep, and make haste. I can fight. No!You must do this, for me. Follow me! Forward. I mean, charge forward.  Make for the lower ground!  That's it! Go on! Stay together! Bring your pretty face to my axe. Wicked Men.Servants of Sauron.They are called to Mordor.The Dark One is gathering all armiesto him.It won't be long now.He will soon be ready. Ready to do what?  To make his war.The last war that will coverall the world in Shadow. We've got to get moving. Come on, Sam.  Mr. Frodo.Look.It's an oliphaunt.  No one at home will believe this. Smeagol? We've lingered here too long.Come on, Sam. Wait! We're innocent travelers! There are no travelers in this land.Only servants of the Dark Tower. We are bound to an errand of secrecy.Those that claim to oppose the enemywould do well not to hinder us. The enemy? ,His sense of duty was no lessthan yours, I deem.,You wonder what his name is......where he came from.,And if he was really evil at heart.,What lies or threats led himon this long march from home.,If he would not rather have stayed there......in peace.,War will make corpses of us all.,Bind their hands. It's true, you don't seemany Dwarf women.And in fact, they are so alikein voice and appearance......that they're often mistakenfor Dwarf men. Because I have to believehe can come back. You can't save him, Mr. Frodo. What do you know about it?Nothing! ,I'm sorry, Sam. I don't knowwhy I said that. I do. ,It's the Ring.You can't take your eyes off it.I've seen you.You're not eating. You barely sleep. ,It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo. You have to fight it. I know what I have to do, Sam.The Ring was entrusted to me.It's my task.Mine! My own! Can't you hear yourself?Don't you know who you sound like?  That one counts as mine! ,Stinking creature. Aragorn! Aragorn? Tell me what happenedand I will ease your passing. He's......dead.He took a little tumble off the cliff. (,You lie. Get the wounded on horses.The wolves of lsengard will return.Leave the dead. Come. At last! Helm's DeepThere it is, Helm's Deep.We're safe! We're safe, my lady.Thank you. Mama!  Eothain!Freda! Where is the rest? This is all we could save, my lady. Take it to the caves.              Simbelmyne. Ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebearers.,Now it shall cover the grave    of my son. Alas that these evil days should be mine. The young perish and     the old linger. That I should live......to see the last days of my house. Theodred's death was not of your making. No parent should have to bury their child. He was strong in life. His spirit will find its way to the halls of your     fathers. Westu h'l. Fer'u, Th'odred, Fer'u.  They had no warning. They were unarmed. Now the Wild Men are moving     through the Westfold, burning as they go. Rick, cot and tree.     Where is Mama?     Pull back! Pull back!          It's gone Mr Frodo. The light's passed on, away towards the North.     Something's drawn its gaze.     Hold your ground! Hold your ground!      Sons of Gondor, of Rohan, my brothers. (They listen to him.) I see it in     your eyes, the same fear that would take the heart of me. A day may come     when the courage of men fails, when we forsake our friends and break all     bonds of fellowship, but it is not this day! An hour of wolves and shattered     shields when the age of men comes crashing down, but it is not this day!     This day we fight!      By all that you hold dear on this good earth, I bid you stand! Men of the     West!     Never thought I'd die fighting side by side with an elf.  The veiling shadow that glowers in the east takes shape.Sauron will suffer no rival.From the summit of Barad-durhis Eye watches ceaselessly.But he is not so mighty yetthat he is above fear.Doubt ever gnaws at him.The rumor has reached him.The heir of Numenor still lives. It's the beards.  This, in turn, has given riseto the belief......that there are no Dwarf women......and that Dwarves just spring outof holes in the ground... ...which is, of course, ridiculous.  It's all right. Nobody panic.That was deliberate.It was deliberate. I haven't seen my niece smilefor a long time.She was a girl when they broughther father back dead.Cut down by Orcs.She watched her mothersuccumb to grief. Then she was left aloneto tend her king in growing fear.Doomed to wait upon an old manwho should have loved her as a father. Gimli.? No, I couldn'tI really couldn't. Make way for the king.Make way for Theoden.Make way for the king. So few. So few of you have returned. Our people are safe.We have paid for it with many lives. My lady. Lord Aragorn......where is he? He fell. Draw all our forces behind the wall.Bar the gate.And set a watch on the surround. What of those who cannot fight, my lord?The women and children? Get them into the caves. , Saruman's arm will have grown long indeed if he thinks he can     reach us here. Helm's Deep has one weakness.Its outer wall is solid rock......but for a small culvertat its base...... which is little more than a drain. How? How can fire undo stone? Sssh  This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash.    ,All     the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron. Ride out and meet     him head on. Draw him away from your women and children.    , You must     fight. You have 2000 good men riding north as we speak. Eomer is loyal to you.     His men will return and fight for their king.  They will be 300     leagues from here by now. Eomer cannot help us. I know what it is you want     of me......but I will not bring further death to my people. I will not risk     open war. Open war is upon you, whether you would risk it or not. When last I looked......Theoden, not Aragorn, was King of Rohan. By order of the king......the city must empty. We make for the refuge of     Helm's Deep. Do not burden yourself with treasures. Take only what provisions you     need. Helm's Deep. They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight. Who will     defend them if not their king? He's only doing what he thinks is best for his people. Helm's Deep has     saved them in the past. There is no way out of that ravine. Theoden is walking into a trap. He     thinks he's leading them to safety. What they will get is a massacre.     Theoden has a strong will, but I fear for him. I fear for the survival of     Rohan. , He will need     you before the end,    Aragorn. The people of Rohan will need you. ,The defenses , to hold.      What about side by side with a friend? ,      Aye! I could do that.     Do you remember the Shire Mr Frodo? It will be Spring soon and the orchards     will be in blossom. And the birds will be nesting in the hazel thickets. (He     is crying.) And they will be sowing the summer barley in the lower fields,     (Frodo opens his eyes and looks at him.) and eating the first of the     strawberries and cream. Do you remember the taste of strawberries?      No Sam. I can't recall the taste of food, nor the sound of water or the     touch of grass. I'm naked in the dark. There's' there's nothing, no veil     between me and the wheel of fire. ,I can see him with my waking eyes!      Then let us be rid of it once and for all! Come on Mr Frodo, I can't carry     it for you, but I can carry you! Come on!      Aragorn! ,     Elessar!      For Frodo.      Look Mr Frodo, a doorway! We're almost there!      Clever Hobbits to climb so high! ,Mustn't go that way. Mustn't hurt the     precious!     You swore! You swore on the precious!  Sauron fears you, Aragorn.He fears what you may become.And so he'll strike hard and fastat the world of Men.He will use his puppet Sarumanto destroy Rohan.War is coming.Rohan must defend itselfand therein lies our first challenge......for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.    ,The king's mind is enslavedit's an old device of Saruman's.His hold over King Theodenis now very strong.Sauron and Sarumanare tightening the noose.But for all their cunning......we have one advantage. The Ring remains hidden.And that we should seek to destroy it......has not yet enteredtheir darkest dreams. And so the weapon of the enemyis moving towards Mordor......in the hands of a Hobbit.Each day brings it closerto the fires of Mount Doom. We must trust now in Frodo.Everything depends upon speed......and the secrecy of his quest. Do not regret your decision to leave him.Frodo must finish this task alone. He's not alone.Sam went with him. Did he?Did he, indeed? Good. Yes, very good. The Black Gate of Mordor. Oh, save us.My old Gaffer would have a thing or twoto say if he could see us now. Master says to show himthe way into Mordor.So good Smeagol doesmaster says so. I did. That's it, then.We can't get past that. Look!The gate.It's opening!I can see a way down. Sam, no! I made some stew.It isn't much, but it's hot.  Thank you. ,It's good. Really?  My uncle told me a strange thing.He said that you rode to warwith Thengel, my grandfather.But he must be mistaken. King Theoden has a good memory.He was only a small child at the time. Then you must be at least 60. Seventy?But you cannot be 80! Eighty-seven. You are one of the Dunedain.A descendant of Numenorblessed with long life.It was said that your racehad passed into legend. There are few of us left.The Northern Kingdomwas destroyed long ago. I'm sorry. Please, eat.  Did we lose him? I think we lost him. I'm going to rip outyour filthy little innards! Come here! Trees. Climb a tree. What kind of devicecould bring down the wall?  If the wall is breachedHelm's Deep will fall. Even if it is breached, it would takea number beyond reckoning......thousands, to storm the Keep. Tens of thousands. But, my lord, there is no such force.  A new power is rising.Its victory is at hand. This night......the land will be stainedwith the blood of Rohan!March to Helm's Deep!Leave none alive! To war!  There will be no dawn for Men.  Look. There's smoke to the south. There is always smoke rising......from lsengard these days. Isengard? There was a time......when Saruman would walk in my woods.But now he has a mind of metal......and wheels.He no longer cares for growing things. What is it?     The eagles! The eagles are coming!           I'm here Sam!      Destroy it!      Go on! Now! Throw it in the fire!     What are you waiting for? Just let it go!     The Ring is mine!      No!      Nooooooo!     Yeees! , Yeees!    , Precious! My Precious!     They will hold. The Grey Pilgrim.     That's what they used to call me. Three hundred lives of Men I've walked     this earth, and now I have no time. With luck, my search will not be in     vain. ,Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day. At dawn, look to     the east. Go. That horse is half mad, my lord. There's nothing you can do.

No.         I go to my fathers, in whose mighty company; I shall not now feel ashamed.         Eowyn.       Release us!       Bad idea!

I've always been taller than you. Pippin, everyone knows I'm the tall one.You're the short one. Please, Merry.You're what? Three-foot-six? At the most?Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7". ,3'8"!    It's going to the Great Eye, along with everything else.       I don't take orders from stinking Morgul-rats!       You touch it and I'll stick this blade in your gut!         The scum tried to knife me.  Kill him!       That's for Frodo!       And the Shire!       And that's for my old gaffer!       Stop your squealing you dunghill rat!       I'm gonna bleed you like a stuck pig!       Not if I stick you first!       Sam!       Oh Sam, I'm so sorry.  Sorry for everything.       Let's get you out of here.      Rohan.Home of the Horse-lords.There's something strange at work here.Some evil gives speedto these creatures.Sets its will against us. Legolas! What do your Elf-eyes see? The Uruks turn northeast.They are taking the Hobbits to lsengard. Saruman. The world is changing.Who now has the strength to standagainst the armies of Isengard......and Mordor?To stand against the might of Sauronand Saruman......and the union of the two towers? Together, my Lord Sauron...... we shall rule this Middle-earth. The Old World will burnin the fires of industry.The forests will fall.A new order will rise.We will drive the machine of warwith the sword and the spear...... and the iron fists of the Orc. We have only     to remove those who oppose us. I want them armed and ready to marchwithin two weeks! But, my lord, there are too many!They cannot all be armed in timewe don't have the means. Build a dam, block the streamwork the furnaces night and day. We don't have enough fuelto feed the fires. Hobbits?Never heard of a Hobbit before.Sounds like Orc mischief to me! ,They come with fire.They come with axes.Gnawing, biting, breakinghacking, burning! Destroyers and usurpers! Curse them! No!You don't understand. We're Hobbits!Halflings!Shire-folk! Maybe you are......and maybe you aren't.The White Wizard will know. The White Wizard? Saruman. See? See?We've led you out.Hurry, Hobbitses. Hurry! Very lucky we find you.    ,Nice Hobbit. It's a bog. He's led us into a swamp. A swamp, yes, yes.Come, master. We will take youon safe paths through the mist.Come, Hobbits! Come! We go quickly. ,I found it. I did.The way through the marshes.Orcs don't use it.Orcs don't know it.They go around for miles and miles.Come quickly.Soft and quick as shadows we must be. I hate this place. It's too quiet.There's been no sight nor soundof a bird for two days. No, no birdses to eat.No crunchable birdses.We are famished! Yes!Famished we are, precious!  Here.  What does it eats?Is it tasty? ,It tries to chokes us!We can't eats Hobbit food!We must starve!     Well, starve, then. And good riddance! Oh, cruel Hobbit.It does not care if we be hungry.Does not care if we should die. ,Not like master.Master cares.Master knows.Yes.Precious.Once it takes hold of us......it never lets go. Don't touch me! Fly, you fools! No!Gandalf! What is it, Mr. Frodo? Nothing.Just a dream. Can you see the bottom? No! Don't look down, Sam!Just keep going! Catch it! Grab it, Mr. Frodo! Mr. Frodo! I think I've found the bottom. Bogs and ropeand goodness knows what.It's not natural. None of it. What's in this? Nothing.Just a bit of seasoning.I thought maybe if we was havinga roast chicken one night or something. Roast chicken?!     Back!      Mr Frodo!      Oh no! Frodo, Mr Frodo. , Wake up. Don't leave me here     alone. Don't go where I can't follow. Wake up. Not asleep. Dead.         You get back you scum!      What's this?      Killed another one has she?      No. , This fellow ain't dead.     , Not dead.      She jabs him with her stinger and he goes as limp as a boned fish aaa' then she has her way with them. That's how she likes to feed. Fresh blood. Get him to the Tower!      Samwise you fool.     This scum will be awake in a couple of hours.     Then he'll wish he'd never been born.     The house of his spirit crumbles., He is burning. Already burning.  You remember the Old Foreston the borders of Buckland?Folk used to say there was something inthe water that made the trees grow tall......and come alive. Alive? Trees that could whisper......talk to each other......even move. I'm starving.We ain't had nothing but maggoty breadfor three stinking days. Yeah!Why can't we have some meat?! ,What about them?They're fresh. They are not for eating. What about their legs?They don't need those. They look tasty.  Get back, scum!The prisoners go to Saruman.Alive and unspoiled. Alive? ,Why alive?Do they give good sport? They have something.An Elvish weapon.The master wants it for the war. They think we have the Ring. Ssh!As soon as they find out we don'twe're dead. Kill him. They're not coming from the North! To the river quick, quick! Go, come on! Faster! ,     Draw swords.  Hold! Hold them!  What?  Amon D'n. The beacon! The beacon of Amon D'n is lit.  Hope is kindled!  The beacons of Minas Tirith! The beacons are lit!  Gondor calls for aid. And Rohan will answer! Muster the Rohirrim. ,     Assemble the army at Dunharrow, as many men as can be found. You have two     days. , On the third, we ride for Gondor' and     war.  Forward!  Three-foot-eight.You did something. Merry, don't! Don't drink it! Merry!No, Treebeard said that youshouldn't have any. I want some! lt could well be dangerous! Give me it back. Merry! What's happening?! Aaagh!It's got my leg! Help! Away with you.You should not be waking.Eat earth. Dig deep. Drink water. Go to sleep.Away with you. ,Come, the forest is waking up. It isn't safe.The trees have grown wildand dangerous.Anger festers in their hearts.Black are their thoughts.Strong is their hate.They will harm you if they can.There are too few of us now.Too few of us Ents left to manage them.   It's too late.  It's over.  They've taken it Sam,  they took the Ring!        Begging your pardon but they haven't.       I thought I'd lost you.  So I took it, only for safekeeping.        Give it to me! ,  Give me the Ring Sam.    ,  Sam!  Give me the Ring.    ,  You must understand.  The Ring is my burden.  It will destroy you Sam.       Come on Mr Frodo.  We'd best find you some clothes.  You can't go walking through Mordor in nowt but your skin.       We did it Mr Frodo.  We made it to Mordor.       There are so many of them.  We'll never get through unseen.       It's Him, the Eye!       We have to go in there Mr Frodo.  There's nothing for it. ,  Come on let's just make it down the hill for starters.       Frodo has passed beyond my sight. ,  The darkness is deepening.       If Sauron had the Ring we would know it.         It's only a matter of time.  He has suffered a defeat, yes, but behind the walls of Mordor our enemy is regrouping.       Let him stay there!  Let him rot!  Why should we care?       Because 10,000 Orcs now stand between Frodo and Mount Doom.     The Forest of Fangornlies on our doorstep. Burn it. Yes. We will fight for you. Swear it. We will die for Saruman. The Horse-Men took your lands.They drove your people into the hillsto scratch a living off rocks. Murderers! Take back the lands they stole from you.Burn every village! We have only to remove thosewho oppose us.It will begin in Rohan.Too long have these peasantsstood against you.But no more. Eothain! Eothain!You take your sister.You'll go faster with just two. Listen to me. You must ride to Edorasand raise the alarm. Do you understand me? There are dead things!Dead faces in the water. All dead. All rotten.Elves and Men and Orcses.A great battle long ago.Dead Marshes.Yes. Yes, that is their name.This way.Don't follow the lights. Careful now! Or Hobbits go downto join the dead ones......and light little candlesof their own. Frodo!     Gollum? Don't follow the lights. Gollum! Mr. Frodo!Are you all right? So bright.So beautiful. (strokes his own palm)Our precious. Master should be resting.Master needs to keep up his strength. Who are you? Mustn't ask us. Not its business.Gollum. Gollum. It must be getting near teatime. Leastways it would be in decent places     where there is still teatime. We're not in decent places. Mr Frodo? What is it? It's just a feeling. I don't think I'll be coming back. Yes you will. Of course you will. That's just morbid thinking. We're     going there and back again just like Mr Bilbo. You'll see. I think these lands were once part of the Kingdom of Gondor. Long ago, when there was a King. Mr Frodo, look! The King has got a crown again.   What are     they eating when they can't get hobbit ?                      Who is     she ? This woman you sing of ?  Tis the Lady of L'thien. The Elf Maiden who gave her love     to Beren ... a mortal What happened to her?  She died.     The power of Isengard is at your command Sauron. Lord of the Earth  Stay close young     hobbits. Frodo! , Frodo! ..and are never seen again Your coming to us , is as the footsteps of doom.     You bring great evil here! ,Ringbearer! Mr Frodo ? Well! Here's one dwarf she won't ensnare so easily! I     have the eyes of a hawk, and ears of a fox!  Oh!  The dwarf     breathes so loud, we could have shot him in the dark. Mae govannen, Legolas Thranduilion.  You never know. Sam. My dear Sam. It's very special, that.It's the best salt in all the Shire. It is special. It's a little bit of home. We can't leave this here for someoneto follow us down. Who's gonna follow us down hereMr. Frodo?It's a shame, really.Lady Galadriel gave me that.Real Elvish rope.    Well, there's nothing for it.It's one of my knots.Won't come free in a hurry. Real Elvish rope. Mordor. The one place in Middle-earthwe don't want to see any closer.And it's the one placewe're trying to get to.It's just where we can't get.    Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.I don't think Gandalf meant for us tocome this way. He didn't mean for a lot of thingsto happen, Sam......but they did. Mr. Frodo?It's the Ring, isn't it? It's getting heavier. What food have we got left? Let me see.Oh, yes. Lovely.Lembas bread. And look!More lembas bread. I don't usually hold with foreign food.....but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad. Nothing ever dampens your spiritsdoes it, Sam? My old sword, Sting , Here, take it, take it. Its so light! Yes Yes , Made by the elves you know. The blade glows blue     when orcs are close and its times like that my lad, when you have to be     extra careful.    Here's a pretty thing. , Mithril!    ,     as light as a feather and as hard as dragon scales. Let me see you put     it on, go on.  My my     old ring. Well I should... very much like to hold it again, one last     time.  I'm sorry I brought this upon you my boy    , I'm sorry that you must carry this     burden ,I'm sorry for everything The Ringbearer is setting out on the quest of Mount Doom and     you who travel with him, , no oath nor bond is laid to go further than you will    ,Farewell. Hold to     your purpose and may the blessings of elves , and men ,,     and all free folk , go with     you.  You are no elf Men of the South are welcome here  Who are you ? I'm a friend of Gandalf the Grey  Then we are here on a     common purpose , friend. The shards of Narsil , The blade that cut the Ring from     Sauron's hand , Ah! ,Its still sharp , but no more than a broken heirloom     Why do you fear the past. You are Isildur's heir, not     Isildur himself. You are not bound to his fate     He's not dead. HE'S NOT DEAD , NO! NO! He's not dead.      Farewell Peregrin son of Paladin.     NO! NO!      I release you from my service. ,Go now and die and what way seems best to you.      Come on soldier, move it.      Hurry along there, hurry along.     Gandalf! , Where's     Gandalf? , GANDALF!     Just a mouthful......a bit of the flank. Looks like meat's back on the menuboys. Pippin.Let's go. Go on.Call for help. Squeal.No one's going to save you now.  Aaaaaaaagh! A red sun rises.Blood has been spilled this night. Riders of Rohan......what news from the Mark? What business does an Elf, a Manand a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?Speak quickly! Give me your name, horse-masterand I shall give you mine. I would cut off your head, Dwarf......if it stood but a little higherfrom the ground. You would die before your stroke fell. I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.This is Gimli, son of Gloinand Legolas of the Woodland Realm.We are friends of Rohanand of Theoden, your king. Theoden no longer recognizesfriend from foe. Not even his own kin. ,Saruman has poisoned the mindof the king......and claimed lordship over these lands.    My company are those loyal to Rohan.And for that, we are banished.The White Wizard is cunning.He walks here and there, they say......as an old man hooded and cloaked.And everywhere, his spiesslip past our nets. Very good sir. Gamling.  Make haste across the Riddermark. Summon every able-bodied man to     Dunharrow.  I will.  Do you ride with us? Just to the encampment. It's tradition for the women of the court to     farewell the men. ,        The men have found their captain. They will follow you into battle. Even     to death. You have given us hope.  Excuse me! , I have     a sword. Please accept it! , I offer you my service Theoden King. And gladly, I accept it. ,     You shall be Meriadoc, esquire of Rohan.  Horse men! I wish I could muster an army of Dwarves, fully armed and     filthy.  Your kinsmen may have no need to ride to war. I fear war already     marches on their own lands.    Now is the hour,     Riders of Rohan. Oaths you have taken. Now fulfil them all, to Lord and     Land! Hah! Why are there so few of youwhen you have lived so long? Are there Ent children? Bru-ra-hroom.There have been no Entingsfor a terrible long count of years. Why is that? We lost the Entwives. Oh, I'm sorry. How did they die? Die? No.We lost them.And now we cannot find them. I don't suppose you've seen Entwives in the Shire? Can't say that I have. You, Pip?  What do they     look like? I don't remember now. Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld. There dwells Theoden,     King of Rohan...... whose mind is overthrown. Saruman's hold over King     Theoden is now very strong. My lord, your son......he is dead. , My lord? Uncle? Will you not go to him? Will you do     nothing? Be careful what you say.Do not look for welcome here.     Oh, he must have died sometime in the night. What a tragedy     for the king......to lose his only son and heir.   I've sent him to his death.       No.  There is still hope for Frodo.  He needs time and safe passage across the plains of    Gorgoroth.  We can give him that.       How?       Draw out Sauron's armies.  Empty his lands.   Then we gather our full strength and march on the Black Gate.       We cannot achieve victory through strength of arms.       Not for ourselves.  But we can give Frodo his chance if we keep Sauron's eye fixed upon us.   Keep him blind to all else that moves.       A diversion.       Certainty of death, small chance of success, what are we waiting for?       Sauron will suspect a trap.  He will not take the bait.       Oh, I think he will.       Long have you hunted me.  Long have I eluded you.  No more! ,  Behold, the Sword of Elendil!     Yes, Mama. I don't want to leave.I don't want to go, Mama.  Freda, I will find     you there. Quickly! ,Go, child. Rohan, my lord......is ready to fall. Theodred.Find the king's son! Mordor will pay for this These Orcs are not from Mordor. My Lord Eomer, over here! He's alive. Theodred. Your son is badly wounded, my lord. He was ambushed by Orcs.If we don't defend our countrySaruman will take it by force That is a lie.Saruman the White has ever beenour friend and ally. Gandalf told me you wereone of the river-folk. Cold be heart and hand and boneCold be travellers far from home He said your life was a sad story. They do not see what lies aheadWhen sun has failed and moon is dead You were not so very differentfrom a Hobbit once.Were you?Smeagol. What did you call me? That was your name once, wasn't it?A long time ago. My name.My name.Smeagol. Aagh! Black Riders! Hide! Hide! Come on, Frodo. Come on! Quick! They will see us!They will see us! I thought they were dead. Come on, Hobbits! Mustn't stop now. This way!  So I imagine this is just a ceremonial position. , I mean, they don't actually expect me to do any     fighting, do they?  You're in the service of the steward now. You'll have to do as you are     told Peregrin Took.  Ridiculous Hobbit! Guard of the Citadel!  Thank you.  There's no more stars! Is it time?  Yes. It's so quiet.  It's the deep breath before the plunge.  I don't want to be in a battle. But waiting on the edge of one I can't     escape is even worse. , Is     there any hope Gandalf, for Frodo and Sam?  There never was much hope. Just a fool's hope. , Our enemy is ready.     His full strength's gathered. Not only orcs, but men as well    , Legions of Haradrim from     the South, mercenaries from the coast ,     All will answer Mordor's call.  Come on! Build     me an army worthy of Mordor What orders from Mordor my Lord? What does the Eye command? We have work to do The trees are strong my Lord. The roots go deep Rip them all down  This was the great watch tower of Amon      These are for you.     Keep them close, I'm going to have a look round, Stay here     My tomato's burst! Can I have some bacon? OK. Want a tomato Sam ?      What are you doing ? Tomatoes, sausages, nice crispy bacon  Saved     some for you Mr Frodo Look Frodo. It's Mr Bilbo's trolls He's going cold! Is he going to die ? He's passing into the Shadow world. He'll soon become a wraith     like them.  They're close! Sam! Do you know the Athelas plant ? Govannas v'n gwennen le, Haldir o L'rien.  A, Aragorn in D'nedain istannen le ammen.   Haldir So much for the legendary courtesy of the Elves! Speak words     we can also understand! We have not had dealings with the dwarves, since the dark     days. nan  That! was not so courteous!      You bring great evil with you ,You     can go no further! Boe ammen veriad l'n. Andelu i ven!  Merin le telim.      Aragorn!   Andelu i ven.  Frodo, come and help an old man ,How's your shoulder? Those rain clouds might. This looks strangely familiar. It's because we've been here before.We're going in circles. What is that horrid stink?I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby. Can you smell it? Yes.....I can smell it.................We're not alone. The thieves............... The thieves.The filthy little thieves.Where is it?.............Where is it?They stole it from us.............My precious.........Curse them, we hates them!It's ours, it is, and we wants it! This is Sting.You've seen it before......haven't you, Gollum?Release him or I'll cut your throat. Yessssss It burns!It burns us!It freezes!Nasty Elves twisted it. Take it off us! Quiet, you!It's hopeless. Every Orc in Mordor'sgoing to hear this racket.    Let's just tie him up and leave him. No!That would kill us! Kill us! It's no more than you deserve! Maybe he does deserve to die.But now that I see him, I do pity him. We be nice to themif they be nice to us.Take it off us.We swears to do what you wants................We swears. Mr Frodo ? , Frodo! Frodo!     , I thought I'd lost you What are you talking about ? It's just something Gandalf said.  What did he say? The Fellowship awaits the Ringbearer.  Mordor, Gandalf, is it left or right ?      Left. We must hold this course west of the Misty Mountains for     forty days. If our luck holds the Gap of Rohan will still be open to us.    , and there are     road turns east to Mordor. Good, very good.  Move your feet You look good Pippin      Thanks   If     anyone was to ask for my opinion, which I note that they're not, I'd say     that we were taking the long way round. Gandalf, we could pass through the     Mines of Moria. My cousin Balin would give us a royal welcome.  No Gimli, I would not take the road through Moria unless I     had no other choice. ARGH! Sorry!  Get him!  For the Shire. Hold him, hold him down Merry!     Gentlemen, that's enough!  The same blood flows in my veins , The same weakness   Your time     will come. You will face the same evil and you will defeat it     A si i-Dh'ath '-orthor, Aragorn. ' or le a ' or nin.  Renech i lu i erui govannen? (,) Nauthannem i ned ol reniannen.

I would rather share one lifetime     with you than face all the ages of this world alone  I choose a mortal life You cannot give me this It is mine to give to whom I will. Like my heart     Strangers from distant lands, friends of old. You have     been summoned here to answer the threat of Mordor. Middle Earth stands     upon the brink of destruction. None can escape it. You will     unite or you will fall. Each race is bound to this fate, this one     doom., Bring forth the Ring, Frodo  So     it's true  In a dream , I saw the Eastern sky grow dark ,In the West a pale light lingered A     voice was crying, your doom is near at hand , Isildur's bane is found    , Isildur's Bane We are no spies.We track a party of Uruk-haiwestward across the plain.They have taken two of our friendscaptive. The Uruks are destroyed.We slaughtered them during the night. But there were two Hobbits.Did you see two Hobbits with them? They would be small.Only children to your eyes. We left none alive.We piled the carcasses and burned them.  Dead? I am sorry. Hasufel! Arod! ,May these horses bear you to betterfortune than their former masters.,Farewell. Look for your friends.But do not trust to hope.It has forsaken these lands. We ride north! It's one of their wee belts.  Hiro hyn h'dh'     ab 'wanath...  Aaaaagh! I understand. His passing is hard to accept. Especially now     that your brother has deserted you. Leave me alone, snake! Oh, but you are alone. Who knows what you've spoken to the     darkness ,......in     the bitter watches of the night......when all your life seems to shrink. The     walls of your bower closing in about you. A hutch to trammel some wild thing     in.    ,So fair. So cold. Like a morning of pale spring......still clinging     to winter's chill.     Your words are poison. You'll find more cheer in a graveyard. I cannot allow you before Theoden King so armed, Gandalf     Greyhame. By order of Grima Wormtongue. Your staff Hmmm ,You     would not part an old man from his walking stick.      My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming. He's a herald of woe. The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late......Theoden     King.  He's     not welcome. Why should I welcome you......Gandalf Stormcrow?     A just question, my liege. ,Late is the hour......in which this     conjurer chooses to appear., Lathspell I name him.Ill news is an ill guest. Be silent. Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth. I have     not passed through fire and death......to bandy crooked words with a witless     worm.  His staff. I     told you to take the wizard's staff. Grima.Grima.,Grima. Orcs are roaming freelyacross our lands.Unchecked. Unchallenged.Killing at will.Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman Why do you lay these troubleson an already troubled mind?Can you not see?Your uncle is weariedby your malcontent......your warmongering. Warmongering?,How long is it sinceSaruman bought you?What was the promised price, Grima?When all the Men are deadyou will take your share of the treasure? Too long have you watched my sister.Too long have you haunted her steps. You see much, Eomer, son of Eomund. Too much.You are banished forthwithfrom the kingdom of Rohan......and all its domainsunder pain of death. You have no authority here.Your orders mean nothing. This order does not come from me.It comes from the king.He signed it this morning. Dead?No, you cannot kill them. No. Wraiths!Wraiths on wings!They are calling for it.They are calling for the precious. Mr. Frodo! It's all right.I'm here. Hurry, Hobbits.The Black Gate is very close. Orc blood.

They have feelings, my friend.The Elves began it.Waking up the treesteaching them to speak. Talking trees.What do trees have to talk about?Except the consistencyof squirrel droppings. Aragorn, nad no ennas  This will be the end of Gondor as we know it. Here the hammer stroke     will fall hardest. , If the river is taken, if the garrison at Osgiliath     falls, the last defence of this city will be gone.  But we have the white wizard. That's got to count for something.     Gandalf? Sauron has yet to show his deadliest servant.    ,     The one who will lead Mordor's army in war. , The one they say no living man can kill.    ,     The Witch King of Angmar. You've met him before. ,     He stabbed Frodo on Weathertop. ,     He is the lord of the Nazg'l. The greatest of the nine. The Dead City! Very nasty place full of enemies. Quick, quick!

It began with the forging of the Great Rings.  Three were given to the elves. ,Immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings.    , Seven to the     dwarf lords, great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls.    ,And nine, nine rings were     gifted to the race of men. , Who above all else, desire power.  Tonight we remember those who gave their blood to defend this country. Hail the victorious dead Hail!  No pauses, , no spills.      Better than it was and the Ring ? , You feel its power growing don't you. I've felt it     too. You must be careful now. Evil will be drawn to you from     outside the Fellowship and I fear from within.  Who then do I trust ? You must trust to yourself. Trust your own strength.  What do you mean ?  There are many powers in this world for good or for evil.     Some are greater than I am and against some I have not yet been tested  Ah!     The walls of Moria! Dwarf doors are invisible when closed  Yes Gimli! Their own masters cannot find them, if their     secrets are forgotten! Why doesn't that surprise me! Ach! It reads "The Doors of Durin, Lord of Moria, Speak Friend     and Enter" What do you suppose that means ? Oh it's quite simple. If you are a friend, you speak     the password and the doors will open ,     Annon Edhellen, edro hi ammen! (     Fennas Nogothrim, lasto beth lammen.

Why not use this Ring ? , Long has my father, the Steward of Gondor kept     the forces of Mordor at bey. By the ,of our people are     your lands kept safe. Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy, let us use     it against him  You cannot wield it. None of us can    ,The One Ring     answers to Sauron alone. It has no other master and what would a     ranger know of this matter ?  Aragorn! This.. is Isildur's heir and heir to the throne of Gondor Havo dad, Legolas (,.) Gondor has     no King. , Gondor needs no King  Aragorn is right. We cannot use it  You have     only one choice. The Ring must be destroyed.  Then what are we waiting for The Ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli, son of Gloin, by any     craft that we here possess. The Ring was made in the fires of Mount Doom.     Only there can it be unmade. It must be taken deep into Mordor and     cast back into the firey chasm from whence it came. ,One of you........... must do this We failed them. A Hobbit lay here.And the other. They crawled. Their hands were bound. Their bonds were cut. They ran over here. They were followed  The belt! ,Run! Tracks lead away from the battle... ...into Fangorn Forest. Fangorn?What madness drove them in there? Theoden......son of Thengel......too long have you sat in     the Shadows. I would stay still if I were you. Hearken to me! I release you......from the spell.     You have no power here ......Gandalf the ,. I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound. Wait. If I go, Theoden dies. You did not kill me......you     will not kill him. Rohan     is mine. Be gone. I know your face.,     Eowyn. Eowyn. ,Gandalf? Breathe the free air again, my friend. Dark have been my dreams of late.  Man cenich?  The White Wizard approaches. Do not let him speak.He will put a spell on us. We must be quick. You are tracking the footstepsof two young Hobbits. Where are they? Who are you?Show yourself! It cannot be. Forgive me. I mistook you for Saruman. I am Saruman.Or rather, Sarumanas he should have been. You fell. Through fire.....and water. From the lowest dungeonto the highest peak...... I fought with the Balrogof Morgoth. Until at last I threw downmy enemy......and smote his ruinupon the mountainside. No! Hide, hide!  I can feel his blade. ,     We come to it at last. ,The great battle of our time.  Come away Hobbits. We climb. We must climb.  The board is set, the pieces are moving. Up, up, up the stairs we go. And then it's into the tunnel. Hey, what's in this tunnel? ,     You listen to me! You listen good and proper. Anything happens to him,     you'll have me to answer to. One sniff that something's not right, one     hair that stands up on the back of my neck, its over. No more slinker, no     more stinker. , You're     gone. Got it? I'm watching you.  What was that about?  Nothing. Just clearing something up.   Gwaihir go! Gwaihir What are they saying ? Frodo f'r. Ae athradon i hir, tur gwaith nin beriatha hon.    ,  There's been some strange folk crossing the Shire. Dwarves, others of a     less than savoury nature   War's brewing.    , The mountains are fair teeming with     goblins. Children's stories that's all that is. You're beginning to sound     like that old Bilbo Baggins! Cracked he was! Hello, Hello, Fatty Bolger ,Lovely to see you, Welcome, Welcome  Go     on Sam, ask Rosie for a dance. Take her by the safest road. A ship lies anchored in the Grey Havens. It     waits to carry her across the sea. The last journey of Arwen Und'miel.  There is nothing for you here only death. Lady Arwen we cannot delay. , My lady! Tell me what you have seen. Arwen. You have the gift of foresight. What did you see? I looked into your future and I saw death. But there is also life. You saw there was a child. You saw my son. For within these rings was bound the strength and will     to govern each race. ,     But they were all of them deceived. ,For another ring was made. , In the land of Mordor, ,in the fires of Mount Doom (, the dark Lord Sauron forged in     secret a master Ring ,to control all others and into this Ring he poured     all his cruelty, his malice , and his will to     dominate all life. , One Ring to rule them all.  One by one the free lands of Middle Earth fell to the     power of the Ring. But there were some who resisted. , A last     alliance of Elves and Men marched against the armies of Mordor. And on the     slopes of Mount Doom they fought for the freedom of Middle Earth.  Tangado haid!  Leithio i philinn!  Victory was near. , But the     power of the Ring , could not be undone.  It was in this moment, ,that Isildur, son of the King, took up his father's sword.  Sauron, the enemy of the Free Peoples of Middle Earth     was defeated. , The Ring passed to Isildur.    , Who had this one chance to destroy evil     forever. , But the hearts of Men are easily corrupted.    ,     And the Ring of Power has a will of its own.  It betrayed Isildur ,to his death. ,And some things that should not have been forgotten were lost.    ,History became legend, legend     became myth, , and for two and a half thousand years the Ring passed out of     all knowledge. , Until, when chance came    , It     ensnared a new bearer.  My Precious!  The Ring came to the creature Gollum who took it deep     into the tunnels of the Misty Mountains. , And there it consumed him. It came to me, my own, my love, my own, my Precious.     The Ring brought to Gollum unnatural long life. For     five hundred years it poisoned his mind. And in the gloom of Gollum's cave     it waited. ,     Darkness crept back into the forests of the world. Rumour grew of a shadow     in the East, whispers of a nameless fear. , And     the Ring of Power perceived. ,     Its time had now come. , It abandoned Gollum.    , But something happened then     that the Ring did not intend, it was picked up by the most unlikely creature     imaginable.  What's this?  A Hobbit. Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.         And no regurgitation!  So' it's a drinking game? Aye!  Last one standing wins heh heh heh! Lets drink to Victory! To Victory! West' Aragorn, hal I am very happy for you. He is an honourable man. You are both honourable men.  It was not Theoden of Rohan who led our people to victory. Ach, don't listen to me.

Its black gates     are guarded by more than just orcs. There is evil there that does not sleep     and the great eye is ever watchful. Tis a barren wasteland, riddled     with fire and ash and dust. The very air you breathe is a poisonous     fume. Not with ten thousand men could you do this.    ,It is folly  Have you     heard nothing Lord Elrond has said? The Ring must be destroyed and I suppose you think you're the one to do it. and if we fail what then ? , What happens when Sauron takes back what is his ?  I will be     dead before I see the Ring in the hands of an elf Never trust an elf Do you not understand that while we bicker amongst     ourselves, Sauron's power grows?! None can escape it! You'll all be     destroyed Your fingers would remember their old strength     better......if they grasped your sword. I've only......ever served you, my lord.         Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast! Send me not from your sight. No, my lord! No, my lord. Let him go. Enough blood has been     spilt on his account. Get out of my way! Hail, Theoden King! Where is Theodred? Where is my son? Darkness took me......and I strayed out of thoughtand time. Stars wheeled overhead......and every day was as longas a life age of the Earth.But it was not the end.I felt life in me again. I've been sent back...... until my task is done. Gandalf. Gandalf? ,Yes.That was what they used to call me.Gandalf the Grey.That was my name. I am Gandalf the White.And I come back to you now......at the turn of the tide. One stage of your journey is over.Another begins. We must travel to Edoras with all speed. Edoras?That is no short distance! We hear of trouble in Rohan.It goes ill with the king. Yes, and it will not be easily cured. Then we have run all this way for nothing?Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here......in this horrid, dark, dank tree-infested--?    ,I mean, charming......quite charming forest. It was more than mere chance thatbrought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.A great power has been sleeping herefor many long years.The coming of Merry and Pippinwill be like the falling of small stones......that starts an avalanchein the mountains. In one thing you have not changeddear friend.,You still speak in riddles.     A thing is about to happen that has nothappened since the Elder Days.The Ents are going to wake up.....and find that they are strong.      Young Mr Frodo here, he's cracking!  and proud of     it! Cheers Gaffer!  Cheers Well it's none of our concern what goes on beyond our borders. Keep your     nose out of trouble and no trouble will come to you.  Good Night lads  Good     night, sweet maiden of the golden ale! Oi Mind who you're sweet talking! Don't worry Sam, Rosie knows an idiot when she sees one!  Does she ?      Good Night Sam  Is it secret ? Is it safe ? Ha! , What are you     doing!      Hold out your hand Frodo. Its quite cool. , What can you see ?    , Can you see anything ?  Nothing.     There's nothing , Wait. There are     markings , Its some form of Elvish. I can't     read it There are few who can. The language is that of Mordor, which     I will not utter here.   Ah, I     think I'll just have another ale.  Oh no you dont , Go on      So there I was at the mercy of three monstrous trolls and     they were all arguing amongst themselves about how they were going to cook     us. Whether it be turned on a spit or whether they should sit on us one by     one and squash us into jelly. ,They     spent so much time arguing the witherto's and whyfor's that the sun's first     light cracked open over the top of the trees. Poof!    , and turned them all into     stone! Quickly  No no! the big one, big one! Mrs Bracegirdle, how nice to see you. Welcome welcome.     Are all these children yours ? Yeah Good gracious you have been productive!      Sackville-Bagginses! ,     Quickly! Hide! Oh! Thankyou my boy You're a good lad Frodo. I'm very     selfish you know. ,Yes,     I am. Very selfish. I don't know why I took you in after your mother     and father died, but it wasn't out of charity. I think it was because, of     all my numerous relations, you were the one Baggins that showed real spirit.     Bilbo have you been at the Gaffers homebrew ? No. Well yes, b b b but thats not the point. The point is,     Frodo, , You'll be     alright.  That future is almost gone. But it is not lost. Nothing is certain. Some things are certain. If I leave him now, I will regret it forever. It is time. From the ashes of fire shall be woken,     A light from the shadow shall spring,     Renewed shall be blade that was broken,         The crownless again shall be king. Reforge the sword' ada. Your hands are cold. The life of the Eldar is leaving you.  This was my choice. Ada, whether by your will or not there is no ship     now that can bear me hence. We have just passed into the realm of Gondor. Minas Tirith. City of Kings.  It's the tree! Gandalf, Gandalf. Yes the white tree of Gondor. The tree of the King. Lord Denethor     however, is not the King. He is a steward only, a caretaker of the throne. Now listen carefully. Lord Denethor is Boromir's father. To give him     news of his beloved son's death would be most unwise. And do not mention     Frodo or the Ring. And say nothing of Aragorn either. In fact, its better if     you don't speak at all Peregrin Took.  Hail Denethor son of Ecthelion, Lord and Steward of Gondor. A Ring!   Lost!    , My Precious is lost. For the time will soon come when Hobbits will shape the     fortunes of all. The 22nd day of September in the year 1400    ,by Shire     reckoning. , Bag End,     Bagshot Row, Hobbiton, West Farthing, The Shire, Middle Earth.    , The Third Age of this world.  There and back again, A Hobbit's tale, by Bilbo     Baggins. ,Now, where to begin?     Ah, yes. ,Concerning Hobbits.  Hobbits have been living and farming in the four     Farthings of the Shire for many hundreds of years. , quite content to     ignore and be ignored by the world of the Big Folk. , Middle Earth being,     after all, full of strange creatures beyond count. Hobbits must seem of     little importance, being neither renowned as great warriors, nor counted     amongst the very wise.   Frodo, someone at     the door. ,In fact, it     has been remarked by some that Hobbits' only real passion is for food.    , A rather unfair observation    , As     we have also developed a keen interest in the brewing of ales    ,and the smoking of pipeweed. , But where     our hearts truly lie , is in peace and quiet ,and good     tilled earth. ,For all Hobbits share a love of all things that grow.    ,And yes, no doubt to others, our ways seem quaint    , But today of all days, it is brought home to me it is     no bad thing to celebrate a simple life.  Frodo, the door! ,     sticklebacks, where is that boy! FRODO!  Hmm hmm hmm hmm, Down from the door where it began, hmm     hmm hmm hmm And I must follow if I can. , The road goes     ever on and on, down from the door where it began, now far ahead the road     has gone, and I must follow if I can.       You're late!       Pippin!  Comes from the Green Dragon!  Thank you! I win!  No news of Frodo? No word. Nothing. We have time. Every day Frodo moves closer to Mordor.  Do we know that?  What does your     heart tell you?  That Frodo is alive.     Yes' yes he's alive.  Too risky. Too risky. ,Thieves. They stole it from us. Kill them, kill them, kill them both!    ,  Sshh, quiet, mustn't wake them. Mustn't ruin it now.      But they knows, ,     they knows, they suspects us! What's it saying my precious, my love? Is Smeagol losing his nerve? Soon Mr Elf, you will enjoy the fabelled hospitality of the     dwarves. Roaring fires! Malt Beer! Red Meat off the bone! This my friend is the home of my cousin Balin and they call     it a Mine!  A Mine!  This isn't     a mine, it's a tomb  Nooooo!     NOOOOOOOOOOoooooooo!  Goblins!  We make for the gap of Rohan. We should never have     come here Now get out of here! Get out! Merry.  Hello, Pip. You're hurt. I'm fine. lt was just an act. An act? See? I fooled you too.Don't worry about me, Pippin. What is it? What do you smell? Man-flesh They've picked up our trail.  Aragorn. Let's move! That black rider was looking for something. Or someone (he     walks up to Frodo and looks him in the face) Frodo ? Get down! I have to leave the Shire. ,Sam and I must get to Bree  Right. Bucklebury     Ferry. Follow me. Run! Frodo, this way. Follow me  Frodo! Follow me. Run! Get the rope Sam      Frodo!  Run Frodo!  No! Frodo! Come on! Let the Ringbearer decide We cannot stay here! ,This will be the death of the     hobbits! Frodo ?  We will go through     the Mines So be it Strong?! ,Oh, that's good. So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.Merry and Pippin are quite safe.In fact, they are far saferthan you are about to be. This new Gandalf's more grumpythan the old one. That is one of the Mearas......unless my eyes are cheatedby some spell. Shadowfax.He is the lord of all horses......and has been my friendthrough many dangers.       ls it much further? Bru-ra-hroom. Don't be hasty.You might call it far, perhaps.My home lies deep in the forest......near the roots of the mountain.I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.And safe is where I'll keep you.I believe you will enjoy this next one too. ,It's one of my own compositions.Right. Sleep, little Shirelings.Heed no nightly noise.Sleep till morning light.I have business in the forest.There are many to call.Many that must come. ,The Shadow lies on Fangorn.The withering of all woodsis drawing near. Mordor! In the common tongue it says Done! You're supposed to stick it in the ground     It is in the ground  Outside  It was your idea! Bilbo! Bilbo! Watch out for the dragon         Dragon! Nonsense, there hasn't been a dragon in these parts for a thousand     years.  That was good! Lets get another one! Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took! I might have known! Speech Bilbo  Speech! My dear Bagginses and Boffins, , Tooks and Brandybucks ,, Grubbs ,, Chubbs    ,, Hornblowers ,, Bulgers ,,     Bracegirdles ,, and Proudfoots  PROUDFEET!  I come with tidings in this dark hour and with counsel. Perhaps you come to explain this.  Perhaps you have come to tell me why my son is dead. Boromir died to save us my kinsman and me. He fell defending us from     many foes.  Pippin. I offer you my service, such as it is in payment of this debt.  This is my first command to you. How did you escape and my son did not?     So mighty as man as he was. The mightiest man may be slain by one arrow and Boromir was pierced by     many. Get up! My lord, there will be a time to grieve for Boromir but it is not now.     War is coming. The enemy is on your doorstep. As steward, you are charged     with the defence of this city. Where are Gondor's armies? You still have     friends. You are not alone in this fight. Send word to Theoden of Rohan.     Light the beacons. You think you are wise Mithrandir. Yet for all your subtleties you have     not wisdom. Do you think the eyes of the White Tower are blind? I have seen     more than you know. With your left hand you would use me as a shield against     Mordor and with your right you would seek to supplant me. I know who rides     with Theoden of Rohan. Oh yes, word has reached my ears of this Aragorn, son     of Arathorn. And I tell you now. I will not bow to this Ranger from the     North. Last of a ragged house long bereft of Lordship.  Authority is not given to you to deny the return of the King, steward. The rule of Gondor is mine and no others! Come! All had turned to vain ambition. He would use even his grief as a cloak!     A thousand years this city has stood and now at the whim of a madman it will     fall! And the white tree, the tree of the King will never bloom again. A wizard is never late! Frodo Baggins.    , Nor is he early, he arrives precisely when he means     to.       Its wonderful to see you Gandalf.  You didn't think Id miss your Uncle Bilbo's birthday?     So how is the old rascal? I hear it is going to be a     party of special significance?       You know Bilbo he's got the whole place in an uproar. Well that should please him.  Half the Shire's been invited.     And the rest of them are turning up anyway.  And so life in the Shire goes on, very much as it has     this past age. , Full of its own comings and goings with change coming     slowly, if it comes at all. ,For things are made to endure in     the Shire, passing from one generation to the next. There's always been a     Baggins living here under the Hill, in Bag End        And there always will be.       To tell you the truth, Bilbo has been acting a bit odd     lately. ,I     mean, more than usual. He's taken to locking himself in his study.    , He spends hours     and hours poring over old maps when he thinks I'm not looking.       Where's it gone?       Aaaaah.  He's up to something. , All right then,     keep your secrets! What?  No! No! Never! Smeagol hates nasty Hobbitses. Smeagol wants to see them'. Dead! And we will! Smeagol did it once, he can do it again!     ,     Its ours! Ours! We must get the precious! We must get it back! Patience! Patience my love! First we must lead them to her! We lead them to the winding stair. Yes, the stairs and then? Up, up, up the stairs we go until we come to the tunnel. And when they go in, there's no coming out. She's always hungry. She     always needs to' feed. She must eat. All she gets is filthy Orcses. And they doesn't taste very nice, does they Precious? No, not very nice at all, my love. She hungers for sweeter meats.    ,     Hobbit meat. And when she throws away the bones and the empty clothes     , then we will find it. And take it for Meee! For us. Yes, we meant for us! Gollum, gollum. The precious will be ours once the Hobbitses are dead!  Frodo! Frodo! Strider! , Get off him!     Strider! Into the Mines! Legolas!  We now have but one choice, we must face the long dark of     Moria. Be on your guard, there are older and fouler things than orcs     in the deep places of the world  The wealth of Moria is not in gold, or jewels, but Mithril Bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings that Thorin gave him Aww that was a Kingly gift Yes. I never told him, but its worth was greater than     the value of The Shire!  Pippin! I've no memory of this place Are we lost ? Come on faster! How far to the nearest crossing ?      The Brandywine Bridge, twenty miles. Come on!  What do you want ? We're heading for the Prancing Pony. Hobbits! Four hobbits! What's more out of     The Shire by your talk! What business brings you to Bree? We wish to at the Inn. Our business is our own.  alright young sir, I     meant no offence. ,My job to ask questions after nightfall. There's talk of strange folk     abroad. Can't be too careful  Out of the way! Watch where you're walking! Excuse me ?  Today is my One Hundred and Eleventh birthday!     Happy Birthday! Alas, elevnty-one years is far too short a time to live     among such excellent and admirable hobbits., I don't know half of you half as well as I     should like and I like less than half of you, half as well as you deserve.     Why are they still guarding it?  They guard it because they have hope. A faint and fading hope that one     day it will flower. That a king will come and this city will be as it once     was before it fell into decay. ,     The old wisdom born out of the west was forsaken. Kings made tombs more     splendid than the houses of the living and counted the old names of their     descent , dearer than the names of their sons.    ,     Childless lords sat in aged halls musing on heraldry or in high, cold towers     asking questions of the stars. And so the people of Gondor fell into ruin.    ,     The line of Kings failed. The white tree withered. The rule of Gondor was     given over to lesser men. Mordor. Yes, there it lies. This city has dwelt ever in the sight of its shadow. A storm is coming. This is not the weather of the world. This is a device of Sauron's     making. A broil of fume he sends ahead of his host. The Orcs of Mordor have     no love of daylight, so he covers the face of the sun to ease their passage     along the road to war. When the shadow of Mordor reaches this city it will     begin. Well' Minas Tirith' very impressive. ,So where are off to next? Oh, it's too late for that Peregrin. There's no leaving this city.    ,     Help must come to us. But I know you have something to do with it.       Good gracious me!       Before you came along we Bagginses were very well     thought of.       Indeed? We never had any adventures, or did anything     unexpected.       If you're referring to the incident with the dragon, I     was barely involved. All I did was give your uncle a little nudge out of the     door.       Whatever you did, you've been officially labelled as a     'disturber of the peace.' Oh really? Gandalf! Gandalf!       Fireworks Gandalf! Gandalf! Fireworks Gandalf!       Hooooraaaay!        Gandalf, I'm glad you're back.  You treacherous little toad!  No, no! Master! No Sam! Leave him alone!  I heard it from his own mouth. He means to murder us. Never! Smeagol wouldn't hurt a fly! ,     Aaaagh he is a horrid, fat Hobbit who hates Smeagol and who makes up nasty lies! You miserable little maggot! I'll stove your head in!  Call me a liar? You're a liar! Waaaah!  If you scare him off then we are lost! I don't care! I can't do it Mr Frodo! I won't wait around for him to     kill us! I'm not sending him away. You don't see it do you? He's a villain. We can't do this by ourselves Sam. Not without a guide. I need you on my     side. No I think we are Ssh! Gandalf's thinking What! I'm hungry There's something down there It's Gollum He's been following us for three days He escaped the dungeons of Barad-D'r! Escaped ,     or was set loose and now the Ring has drawn him here ,     He won't ever be rid of his need for it. He hates and loves the Ring,     as he hates and loves himself. Smeagol's life is a sad story    , Yes    , he was once called, before the Ring     found him. Before it drove him mad It's a pity Bilbo didnt kill him when he had the chance Pity ? It was pity that stayed Bilbo's hand.     Many that live deserve death and many that die, deserve life. Can you give     it to them Frodo ? Do not be too eager to deal out death and judgement Even     the very wise cannot see all ends. My heart tells me that Gollum has     some part to play, yet for good or ill.... before this is over.    ,     The pity of Bilbo, may rule the fate of many  I wish the Ring had never come to me. I wish none of     this had happened. So do all who live to see such times, but that is not for     them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that     is given to us. There are other forces at work in this world, Frodo,     besides the will of evil. Bilbo was meant to find the Ring, in which     case you also were meant to have it and that is an encouraging thought.        Oh! Its that way Good Evening little masters. What can I do for you ?     If you're looking for accomodation, we've got some nice, cosy hobbit sized     rooms available. Always proud to cater to the little folk, Mr err... ?  Underhill, my name's     Underhill Underhill , yes.. We're friends of Gandalf the Grey. Can you tell him we've     arrived? Gandalf ? ,Gandalf ? Oh yes! I remember! Elderly chap! Big grey     beard, pointy hat. , Not seen     him for six months.  What do we do now ? Sam. He'll be here. He'll come. What's that ? This my friend, is a pint!  It comes in pints ? hmmmhmmm I'm getting one! You've had a whole half already! That fellow's done nothing but stare at you since we     arrived!  So am I dear boy. , So am I.  No thank     you! We don't want any more visitors, well wishers or distant relations!     And what about very old friends?       Gandalf?       Bilbo Baggins.  My dear Gandalf!  It's good to see you. One hundred and eleven years old     who would believe it. ,     You haven't aged a day!  Come on, come in! Welcome, welcome. Oh, here we are.       Tea or maybe something a little stronger? I've got a     few bottles of the Old Winyard left, 1296, a very good year, almost as old     as I am. It was laid down by my father, what say we open one eh?       Just tea, thank you.       Owwwh!  I was expecting you sometime last week. Not that it     matters; you come and go as you please. Always have done and always will. I'm on your side Mr Frodo I know Sam, I know. Trust me. Come Smeagol.  What time is it? I dreamed I saw a great wave climbing over green lands and above the     hills. I stood upon the brink. It was utterly dark in the abyss before my     feet. A light shone behind me but I could not turn ,     I could only stand there, waiting.  Night changes many thoughts. Sleep Eowyn. Sleep while you can. The stars are veiled. Something stirs in the East, a sleepless malice, The eye of the enemy     is moving. What are you doing?      Pippin! Pippin! Are you mad? I just want to look at it, just one more time. Put it back! He's remembered       No, but the air doesnt smell so foul down here. If in doubt, Meriadoc,     always follow your nose. Let me risk a little more light , Behold the     great realm and dwarf city of Dwarrowdelf. There's an eye-opener and no mistake Gimli! No, no , no Here lies Balin, son of Fundin, Lord of Moria.    , He is dead then.    , Its as I feared.  We must move on,     we cannot linger.      They have taken the Bridge and the second hall. We have barred the     gates, but cannot hold them for long. The ground shakes. Drums    ,     Drums in the deep. We cannot get out. , A shadow moves in the dark.    ,We cannot get out. They are     coming.  Fool of a     Took! , Throw yourself in next time, and rid us of your     stupidity!  Orcs! Get back! and     stay close to Gandalf.      Excuse me. That man in the corner. Who is he ? He's one of them rangers. They're dangerous folk they are.     Wandering the wilds. What his right name is, I've never heard, but     round here, he's known as Strider. Strider Baggins.... Baggins.... Baggins ....Baggins! Baggins! Baggins ? Sure I know a Baggins! He's over     there. Frodo Baggins! He's my second cousin once removed on his     mother's side , and my     third cousin twice removed on his father's side, if you follow me.  Steady on! You cannot hide! ,I see you!    ,There     is no life in the void , Only death! You draw far too much attention to yourself Mr Underhill! A little more caution from you! That is no trinket     you carry! I carry nothing Indeed ,I can avoid being seen if I wish.     But to disappear entirely     That is a rare gift! You've caught me a bit unprepared I'm afraid urm we've     only got cold chicken and a bit of pickle oh and there's some cheese here,     oh no that wont do! Urm we've got raspberry jam, an apple tart    ,     but we've not much for afters. Oh no we're all right, I've found some sponge     cake! , I can make     you some eggs if you ' oh'. Gandalf?        Oh right. ,     You don't mind if I do, do you?  Oh not at all!       Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins!  I'm not at     home! , It's the Sackville-Bagginses. I know you're in there!       They're after the house! , They've never forgiven me for living this     long. I've got to get away from these confounded relatives hanging on the     bell all day, never giving me a moment's peace. , I want to see     mountains again, mountains Gandalf. , And     then find somewhere quiet where I can finish my book. Oh, tea!     So you mean to go through with your plan then?       Yes, yes, it's all in hand. All the arrangements are     made. , Oh, thank you.       Frodo suspects something.       Of course he does, he's a Baggins, not some blockheaded     Bracegirdle from Hardbottle.        You will tell him wont you?  Pippin! He is here! I see you! Help! Gandalf help!  Help him! Pippin! Fool of a Took!  Look at me.  Gandalf, forgive me!  Look at me! What did you see?  A tree, there was a white tree in a courtyard of stone. It was dead.    ,The city was burning. Minas Tirith? Is that what you saw? They have a cave troll! Agh! Let them come There's one dwarf yet in Moria who     still draws breath. Pull! Who are you ? Are you frightened?  Yes Not nearly frightened enough. I know what hunts you.  Let him     go! Or I'll have you Longshanks!  You have a     stout heart little hobbit! But that will not save you. You can no     longer wait for the wizard Frodo. They're coming What are they ? They were once men. Great Kings of Men. The Sauron     the Deciever gave to them nine rings of power. Blinded by their greed     they took them without question. One by one falling into darkness    ,Now they are slaves to his will. They are     the Nazg'l. Ringwraiths. Neither living nor dead. At all times they     feel the presence of the Ring , Drawn to the power of the One    , They     will never stop hunting you. Where are you taking us ? Into the wild  How do we know this Strider is a friend of Gandalf ?  I think a servant of the enemy would look fairer, but feel     fouler. He's foul enough  We have no choice but to trust him Yes, yes. He's very fond of you. I know, he'd probably come with me if I asked him to. I     think in his heart Frodo's still in love with the Shire, the woods, the     fields and the little rivers. I am old Gandalf. I know I don't look it, but     I'm beginning to feel it in my heart. , I feel     thin, sort of stretched like butter scraped over too much bread. I need a     holiday, a very long holiday. And I don't expect that I shall return. In     fact, I mean not to.       Old Toby, the finest weed in the Southfarthing. Gandalf my old friend, this will be a night to     remember.       I saw' I saw him! , I     could hear his voice in my head. And what did you tell him? Speak! He asked me my name. I didn't answer. He hurt me! What did you tell him about Frodo and the Ring?      There was no lie in Pippin's eyes. A fool but an honest fool he remains.     He told Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring. ,We've been strangely fortunate. Pippin saw in the Palantir a glimpse     of the enemy's plan. Sauron moves to strike the city of Minas Tirith.     His defeat at Helm's Deep showed our enemy one thing.    , He knows the Heir of     Elendil has come forth ,     Men are not as weak as he supposed. There is courage still. Strength enough,     perhaps, to challenge him. Sauron fears this. He will not risk the peoples     of Middle Earth uniting under one banner. , He will raze Minas Tirith to the ground    , before he     sees a King return to the throne of men. If the beacons of Gondor are lit     Rohan must be ready for war. Tell me! Why should we ride to the aid of those who did not come to     ours? What do we owe Gondor? I will go! They must be warned!  But where     is he leading us ? To Rivendell Master Gamgee. To the House of Elrond.     D'you hear that! Rivendell! We're going to see the     elves! Gentlemen! We do not stop 'til nightfall What about breakfast ?  You've     already had it We've had one yes. What about second breakfast ? Don't think he knows about second breakfast Pippin     What about elvenses ? Luncheon, Afternoon Tea, Dinner ?     Supper! He knows about them, doesnt he ? I wouldn't count on it They will be. ,     You must come to Minas Tirith by another road. Follow the river. Look to the     black ships. ,     Understand this, things are now in motion that cannot be undone. I ride for     Minas Tirith , and I     wont be going alone. Of all the Hobbits, Peregrin Took, you are the worst! Hurry! Hurry! Where are we going? Why did you look? Why do you always have to look? I don't know, I can't help it. You never can! I'm sorry alright? I won't do it again. Don't you understand? The enemy thinks you have the ring! He is going to     be looking for you Pip. They have to get you out of here. And you? You're coming with me? ,     Merry?  How far is Minas Tirith? Three days ride as the Nazg'l flies. And you'd better hope we don't have     one of those on our tail. Here, something for the road.  The last of the Longbottom Leaf?  I know you've run out. You smoke too much Pippin. But, we'll see each other soon? Wont we? I don't know! I don't know whats going to happen.  Merry?  Run, Shadowfax show us the meaning of haste. Merry!  He's always followed me everywhere I went since before we were tweens. I     would get him into the worst sort of trouble but I was always there to get     him out. Now he's gone. , Just     like Frodo and Sam. One thing I've learnt about Hobbits: They are a most hardy folk. Foolhardy maybe. He's a Took!
